- ✅ Zero "What you learned" / "What AI learned" meta-commentary
- ✅ Zero "Role 1:", "Role 2:", "Role 3:" divisions
- ✅ Natural dialogue examples only (conversation shown, framework hidden)

### Structure Compliance ✅
- ✅ Lesson ends with "## Try With AI" section ONLY
- ✅ No "Key Takeaways", "Summary", "What's Next", "Congratulations" sections
- ✅ Clean closure with markdown delimiter
- ✅ No bloat or navigation helper text

### Layer 2 Demonstration ✅
- ✅ AI as Teacher: Suggests video constraints student might miss
- ✅ AI as Student: Adapts recommendations to student feedback
- ✅ AI as Co-Worker: Convergence through iterative refinement
- ✅ All demonstrated through natural dialogue (invisible pedagogy)

## Proficiency Alignment (B1 - Intermediate)

| Dimension | Target | Verified | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Cognitive Load | 7-10 concepts | 8 concepts identified | ✅ |
| Scaffolding | Moderate | Template + conversation + feedback | ✅ |
| Bloom's Level | Apply/Analyze | Write spec (Apply) + distinguish evals/constraints (Analyze) | ✅ |
| Complexity | Real-world domain | Video generation (not toy calculator) | ✅ |
| Prerequisites | Chapter 13 SDD-RI | Assumed and referenced throughout | ✅ |

**8 Concepts Taught**:
1. Evals-first collaboration pattern
2. Video-domain context and constraints
3. Intent definition (WHAT not HOW)
4. Constraint documentation (technical realities)
5. Success evaluation criteria (measurable vs subjective)
6. Non-goals definition (scope boundary)
7. Specification structure (sections and relationships)
8. Business vs technical requirements separation

## Video-Domain Expertise

### Real-World Constraints Addressed
- **Duration**: Platform-specific (45-60s YouTube, 30-45s website, variable email)
- **Format**: MP4, H.264 codec, 1080p resolution, 30 FPS
- **File Size**: Upload speed (50MB YouTube, <10MB mobile web)
- **Gemini Integration**: Free tier timeout (5 min), retry strategy (3 attempts), session handling
- **Delivery**: Download validation, playback verification, format validation
- **Platform Differences**: Requirements vary by YouTube vs website vs LinkedIn

### Real-World Examples
1. **Sign-up Demo**: SaaS product demo showing workflow speed (45-60s YouTube)
2. **Scheduling Demo**: Calendar app demo for website embedding (30-45s, <10MB, loop behavior)

Both examples show organic requirements discovery through evals-first conversation, not artificial constraints.

## Integration with Chapter 14

### Chapter Progression
```
Lesson 1: Spec-Kit Plus Foundation (understanding framework)
    ↓
Lesson 2: Installation & Setup (tools and configuration)
    ↓
Lesson 3: Constitution Phase (global project rules)
    ↓
Lesson 4: SPECIFY PHASE (this lesson → feature specification)
    ↓
Lesson 5: Clarify Phase (refine spec using /sp.clarify)
    ↓
Lesson 6: Plan Phase (design implementation approach)
    ↓
Lesson 7: Tasks Phase (break plan into atomic work units)
    ↓
Lesson 8: Implement Phase (generate video)
    ↓
Lesson 9: Designing Reusable Intelligence (create skills)
    ↓
Lesson 10: Brownfield Adoption (add to existing projects)
    ↓
Lesson 11: YouTube Capstone (apply skills to upload)
```

**This Lesson's Role**: Applies global rules (Constitution) to specific feature (video specification) in preparation for refinement and planning.

## Learning Outcomes

### Students Will Be Able To

1. **Conduct Evals-First Conversation** ✅
   - Have productive dialogue with AI about video success criteria
   - Ask clarifying questions to explore problem space
   - Document requirements that emerge from conversation

2. **Write Complete Specification** ✅
   - Structure spec with Intent, Constraints, Success Evals, Non-Goals
   - Distinguish WHAT (spec) from HOW (plan)
   - Ensure all sections are present and non-overlapping

3. **Distinguish Video Success Evals from Technical Constraints** ✅
   - Recognize measurable vs subjective criteria
   - Identify platform-specific requirements (YouTube vs website)
   - Understand video-domain constraints (Gemini timeouts, file downloads, playback validation)

4. **Identify Edge Cases and Video-Domain Concerns** ✅
   - Anticipate Gemini generation failures (timeout, resource limits)
   - Plan for file download validation (playback verification)
   - Address format and codec requirements
   - Consider platform-specific constraints

## Testing Notes

### Constitutional Validation
```bash
# Framework visibility check
grep -n "AI as|What you learned|What AI learned|Role [0-9]:" lesson.md
# Result: Zero matches ✅

# Structure check
tail -5 lesson.md
# Result: Ends with Try With AI section ✅
```

- ✅ Evals-first pattern clearly shown in multiple places
- ✅ Three Roles demonstrated through dialogue (no labels)
- ✅ Video-specific constraints present (Gemini, downloads, playback)
- ✅ Common mistakes address real problems
- ✅ Practice exercise is actionable and time-bounded

### Pedagogical Alignment
- ✅ Learning objectives map to content sections
- ✅ Cognitive load within B1 limits
- ✅ Scaffolding appropriate for proficiency tier

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Review lesson content in context of Chapter 14
2. ✅ Test Try With AI prompts with your AI companion
3. ✅ Consider creating `video-spec-template.md` in templates/ directory for easy student access

### Optional Enhancements
1. Add video-type comparison guide (product demo vs tutorial vs social media specs)
2. Expand Gemini-specific constraints (session lifetime, rate limits, concurrent generation)
3. Create student exemplar specs for different video types
4. Add FAQ addressing common confusion points (spec vs plan, success evals vs acceptance criteria)

### Downstream Dependencies
- **Lesson 5 (Clarify)**: Students will run `/sp.clarify` on their spec
- **Lesson 6 (Plan)**: Implementation plan will use this spec as input
- **Lesson 8 (Implement)**: Video generation will validate against success evals from this spec
