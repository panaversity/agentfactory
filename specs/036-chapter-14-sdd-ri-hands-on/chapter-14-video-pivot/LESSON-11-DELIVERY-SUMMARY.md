## What Was Created

A complete **Layer 4 (Spec-Driven Integration)** capstone lesson that demonstrates **intelligence acceleration** through skill reuse and composition.

### Core Teaching Insight

Students will prove the central principle of SDD-RI:

> **Intelligence accumulation compounds.** Your second project using reusable skills takes ~65% less time than your first project building everything from scratch.

### Lesson Flow

1. **Acceleration Principle** (understanding WHY this is faster)

   - Timeline comparison: Video from scratch (3.5 hours) vs YouTube upload with skills (70 minutes)
   - Why YouTube spec is simpler (upstream complexity in skills)
   - Compounding effect visualization (Project 1-10 timeline)

2. **Step 1: Write YouTube Upload Specification** (specification-first)

   - Complete spec template (Intent, Constraints, Success Evals, Non-Goals)
   - Explanation of WHY this spec is shorter than video generation spec
   - Understanding skill encapsulation

3. **Step 2: Reference Your Skills** (composition thinking)

   - How to invoke `/sp.implement --skills generate-video,upload-youtube`
   - What skill composition means (reusing intelligence)
   - Why this is faster than discovering patterns from scratch

4. **Step 3: Execute with /sp.implement** (orchestration)

   - Step-by-step what happens during execution
   - Your role as approval gate (not passive observer)
   - What the AI handles via skills

5. **Step 4: Validate YouTube Upload** (specification compliance)

   - Pre-upload checklist (5 items)
   - Post-upload validation (5 measurable criteria)
   - Success mapping (spec evals to evidence)

6. **Step 5: Reflection on Acceleration** (intelligence analysis)

   - Time comparison documentation
   - Why it was faster (specific reasons)
   - Compounding effect for future projects
   - Portfolio value recognition

7. **Try With AI** (three exploration prompts)
   - Understand how skills enable future projects
   - Measure acceleration metrics
   - Project compound returns over 5+ projects

## Key Pedagogical Features

### Intelligence Acceleration as Primary Learning Outcome

- **Not just**: "Here's how to upload to YouTube"
- **But**: "See how intelligence compounds when you reuse skills"
- **Proof**: Measurable time savings (3.5 hours → 70 minutes)

### Specification as Primary Skill (Not Code)

- YouTube spec is intentionally shorter (demonstrates spec reduction through skill reuse)
- Students explicitly reference skills in `/sp.implement` command
- Success validated by checking spec criteria, not implementation details

### Skill Composition Over Reinvention

- Lesson 9 created `generate-video` and `upload-youtube` skills
- Lesson 11 composes these skills for new feature (YouTube upload)
- Next project using these skills takes even less time
- This pattern compounds across career

### Real Project with Real Output

- Students produce actual YouTube link
- Video is portfolio-ready (shareable with employers)
- Success is observable (not hypothetical)
- Time savings are measurable (not theoretical)

### Reflection on Intelligence Accumulation

- Step 5 explicitly asks students to measure and document acceleration
- Compounding visualization (Project 1: 3.5h, Project 2: 1h, Project 3: 45m, Project 10: 20m)
- Students learn ROI of building reusable intelligence
- Future projects become exponentially faster

## Constitutional Alignment

### ✅ Framework Invisibility

- 0 pedagogical labels ("AI as Teacher", "Three Roles Framework", etc.)
- Framework is implicit in specification + skill execution flow
- Students EXPERIENCE composition without seeing pedagogical scaffolding

### ✅ Layer 4 (Spec-Driven Integration)

- Specification quality is primary decision point
- Skill composition orchestrated through /sp.implement
- Student reviews spec to guide AI execution
- Capstone demonstrates integrated workflow

### ✅ Evals-First Content

- All content maps to 4 learning objectives
- No tangential sections
- Every activity advances toward capstone completion

### ✅ Specification-First Teaching

- Step 1: Write YouTube upload specification
- Step 2: Reference skills (spec informs composition)
- Step 3: Execute with /sp.implement
- Step 4: Validate against specification

### ✅ Proper Ending Structure

- Last section: "Try With AI" (only closing section)
- No "Key Takeaways", "What's Next", or "Congratulations"
- No post-activity meta-commentary
- Ends with actionable exploration prompts

## Key Insight for Future Reference

This lesson demonstrates a critical principle of SDD-RI education:

> **Intelligence accumulation must be proven, not claimed.**

Rather than telling students "skills compound," Lesson 11 shows them:

- Measured time savings (3.5h → 70m)
- Specification simplification (YouTube spec shorter than video spec)
- Explicit skill composition (--skills parameter)
- Compounding visualization (Project timeline: 1st project slowest, 10th project fastest)

Students understand through evidence, not assertion.
