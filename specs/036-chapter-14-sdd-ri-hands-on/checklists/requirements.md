**Feature**: 036-chapter-14-sdd-ri-hands-on
**Validated**: 2025-11-25
**Validator**: spec-architect v2.0
**Verdict**: READY FOR PLANNING

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details in requirements (specifies WHAT not HOW)
- [x] User-focused language throughout
- [x] Business context included (product demo videos for SaaS)
- [x] Clear separation of concerns (pedagogy vs technical vs process)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] All requirements are testable (pass/fail criteria definable)
- [x] All requirements are measurable (quantified thresholds)
- [x] Technology-agnostic success criteria (outcomes not implementations)
- [x] Functional requirements enumerated (21 FRs with IDs)
- [x] Success criteria enumerated (14 SCs with IDs)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Acceptance criteria defined for all user stories
- [x] User scenarios cover primary workflows (3 stories)
- [x] Edge cases identified with solutions (4 categories)
- [x] Scope boundaries explicit (constraints + non-goals)
- [x] Dependencies mapped (prerequisites + downstream)

## Evals-First Validation

- [x] Evals section exists and precedes requirements
- [x] Observable behaviors defined before success criteria
- [x] Measurement methods specified for each learning objective
- [x] All requirements trace back to evals

## Constitutional Alignment

- [x] Principle 1 (Spec Primacy): Students write specs from scratch
- [x] Principle 2 (Progressive Complexity): A2-B1 cognitive limits (max 7 concepts)
- [x] Principle 3 (Factual Accuracy): Verification requirements included
- [x] Principle 4 (Coherent Structure): Pedagogical arc defined
- [x] Principle 5 (Intelligence Accumulation): Skill creation required
- [x] Principle 6 (Anti-Convergence): Modality varies from Ch 13
- [x] Principle 7 (Minimal Content): Non-goals explicitly exclude tangential topics

## Quality Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Testability | 10/10 | All criteria falsifiable with quantified thresholds |
| Completeness | 10/10 | Constraints, non-goals, edge cases, dependencies present |
| Ambiguity | 9/10 | Clear terms; Open Questions appropriate for planning |
| Traceability | 9/10 | Prerequisites, constitution, business goals mapped |
| Evals-First | PASS | Correct ordering, measurable outcomes |

## Open Items (Planning Phase)
