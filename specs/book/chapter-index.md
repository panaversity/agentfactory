## The Agent Factory Learning Journey

This book teaches you to build **Agent Factories**—production systems that transform your domain expertise into **Digital FTEs** (Digital Full-Time Employees) that generate recurring revenue.

### The Two Paths Framework

| Path | Tools | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **General Agents** | Claude Code, Gemini CLI | Reasoning systems for exploration | Research, debugging, **building Custom Agents** |
| **Custom Agents** | OpenAI SDK, Claude SDK, Google ADK | Purpose-built products | Standardized workflows, customer-facing products |

**Key Insight**: General Agents BUILD Custom Agents. This is the paradigm shift.

### Learning Progression

| Parts | Focus | Student Outcome |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Parts 1-3** | Foundation (paradigm, tools, specs) | Understand Agent Factory model |
| **Parts 4-5** | Building blocks (SDD-RI, Python) | Create reusable components |
| **Parts 6-8** | Agent development (SDKs, cloud, LLMOps) | Build Custom Agents |
| **Parts 9-11** | Frontend & realtime (TypeScript, voice) | Create user interfaces |
| **Parts 12-14** | Scale & monetize (organizations, capstone) | **Sell Digital FTEs** |

## Directory Structure Reference

**For complete directory structure specification**: See **`specs/book/directory-structure.md`**

This document provides chapter titles and topics. For exact file paths, naming conventions, and folder organization, consult `directory-structure.md`.

**Quick Reference**:

- Chapters are **directories** (not files): `apps/learn-app/docs/NN-Part-Name/NN-chapter-name/`
- Each chapter contains lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Chapter folders use **lowercase-with-hyphens**
- Part folders use **Title-Case-With-Hyphens**

**Examples** (updated structure):

- Chapter 1: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-agent-factory-paradigm/`
- Chapter 13: `apps/learn-app/docs/04-SDD-RI-Fundamentals/13-specification-driven-development-fundamentals/`
- Chapter 15: `apps/learn-app/docs/05-Python-Fundamentals/15-python-uv-package-manager/`
- Chapter 33: `apps/learn-app/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/33-introduction-to-ai-agents/`

3. Place file in the correct part folder
4. Set `sidebar_position: [N]` in YAML frontmatter to the chapter number
5. Match the title exactly in frontmatter
6. Reference `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` for formatting guidelines

**Agent Factory Alignment Check**: Before writing any chapter, ask:
