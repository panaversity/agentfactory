# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 34 - OpenAI Agents SDK

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)

- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Educational Content Specific

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section present and complete
- [x] Proficiency level stated (B1-B2)
- [x] Layer progression validated (concepts → implementation → integration)
- [x] Chapter teaches AI-native thinking, not just tool mechanics
- [x] L1 lessons build vocabulary/mental models
- [x] Chapter connects to Part 6 running example (TaskManager)
