# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 39 - Agent Skills & MCP Code Execution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Updated**: 2025-12-26 (v2 - corrected goal)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] **Goal clearly defined** (Build skills that implement code execution pattern)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Educational Content Specifics

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section included
- [x] Prior chapter references are specific (Chapter 5, 37, 38)
- [x] Proficiency level stated (B2)
- [x] Lesson structure with pedagogical layers defined (L1→L4)
- [x] Each lesson has concrete BUILD outcome
- [x] **Learning arc makes sense**: MCP (familiar) → Scripts → Workflows → Ship

## Differentiation from Prior Chapters

- [x] Does NOT repeat Chapter 5 basics (SKILL.md structure, three-level loading)
- [x] Does NOT repeat Chapter 37 (MCP architecture, configuration)
- [x] Does NOT repeat Chapter 38 (building MCP servers)
- [x] ADDS: Skills that wrap/orchestrate MCP
- [x] ADDS: Skills that execute scripts
- [x] ADDS: Full code execution pattern implementation

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Spec is ready for `/sp.plan`
- Clear goal: Build skills implementing code execution pattern
- MCP as first example (familiar), then scripts, then full workflows
