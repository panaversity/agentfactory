================================================================================
CONTEXT ESTABLISHED
================================================================================

Chapter: 15 (AI Sales Assistant Capstone)
Part: 4 (Students have Python knowledge, understand SDD-RI from Ch 13-14)
Proficiency Level: B1 (Intermediate - execute full workflows independently)
Pedagogical Layer: L4 (Spec-Driven Integration - orchestrate full workflow)
Cognitive Load: 9 concepts (within B1 limit of 7-10)
Estimated Time: 90 minutes

Key Question Answered: "How do students execute the complete SDD-RI cycle
(specify → plan → tasks → implement) with clear JSON output schema, 
verification, and time tracking?"

================================================================================
MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

INTEGRATION WITH CHAPTER FLOW
================================================================================

Prerequisite (Lesson 01: Project Setup + Constitution):
  - Constitution quality standards (minimum 3 pain points)
  - TIME_TRACKER.md created and ready
  - Spec-Kit Plus framework initialized
  - Project directory structure established

Learning Outcome (Lesson 02):
  - Execute full SDD-RI cycle (specify → plan → tasks → implement)
  - Understand JSON schema design for feature outputs
  - Learn systematic testing and verification
  - Measure baseline time for Feature 1

Preparation for Next Lessons (Features 2-4):
  - JSON schema design pattern model (reusable for all features)
  - Specification→Plan→Tasks→Implement workflow pattern (reusable)
  - Three-URL testing methodology (reusable)
  - Verification checklist pattern (reusable)
  - Time tracking system (reusable)
  - AI collaboration pattern (reusable)

================================================================================
KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
================================================================================

1. Schema-First Approach
   WHY: Students need zero ambiguity about output format BEFORE specification
   HOW: Complete schema shown at very top with field explanations and example
   RESULT: Specification accuracy increases; implementation matches expectations

2. Three-URL Testing Strategy
   WHY: Different industries/sizes expose different extraction challenges
   HOW: Stripe (easy, tech-forward), Nike (medium, retail), JPMorgan (hard, finance)
   RESULT: Students discover edge cases; build robust extraction logic

3. Four-Level Verification Framework
   WHY: Schema compliance alone insufficient; need content + criteria checks
   HOW: Schema → Content Quality → Success Criteria → Failure Recovery
   RESULT: Systematic testing becomes repeatable; students debug methodically

4. Reusability Emphasis
   WHY: Chapter premise is intelligence accumulation across features
   HOW: "Try With AI" Prompt 2 asks explicitly about F1→F2 reusable decisions
   RESULT: Students become aware of reuse patterns; accelerate Feature 2

5. Timing Integration
   WHY: Chapter hypothesis: F4 should take 50% of F1 time (via intelligence reuse)
   HOW: Baseline measurement in F1, comparison targets in F2-F4
   RESULT: Acceleration is measurable; proves intelligence compounds

SUMMARY
================================================================================

Lesson 02 (Feature 1: Lead Profiler) has been comprehensively enhanced from
a 118-line procedural guide to a 369-line, hands-on SDD-RI execution framework.

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Complete JSON schema documentation (zero ambiguity on outputs)
  - 4-level verification framework (systematic testing and debugging)
  - Timing integration (baseline measurement for acceleration proof)
  - Strategic AI prompts (validation partner + reusability advisor)
  - 90%+ hands-on ratio (11 commands, 20+ verification checks)
  - Full Layer 4 (Spec-Driven) workflow (specification → implementation)

IMPACT:
  Students will experience the complete SDD-RI cycle with clear success
  criteria, measurable baselines, and reusable patterns for Features 2-4.
  The lesson proves that intelligence accumulation compounds: if students
  reuse the specification, testing, and verification patterns from Feature 1,
  Feature 4 should complete in 50% of Feature 1 time.

CONSTITUTIONAL ALIGNMENT:
  - No meta-commentary or framework labels exposed
  - Three Roles pattern emerges naturally in Try With AI
  - Specification primacy demonstrated (spec before implementation)
  - Progressive complexity maintained (B1 proficiency, 9 concepts)
  - Minimal content (every section maps to learning objective)
