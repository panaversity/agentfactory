## Constitutional Alignment Achieved

### Principle 18: Three-Role AI Partnership
**Evidence**:
- ✅ **Insertion 1** (Lines 24-26): Explicit framing
  - AI as Teacher: "suggesting standards you might not consider"
  - AI as Student: "learning your team's specific preferences"
  - AI as Co-Worker: "executing reviews alongside you"
  - Connection: "role clarity in action"

- ✅ **Insertion 3** (Lines 203-205): Role flexibility
  - Explicit delegation as "actively directing role"
  - Automatic delegation as "role flexibility"
  - Both recognized as legitimate

**Status**: ✅ EXPLICITLY DEMONSTRATED (not just implied)

---

### Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern
**Evidence**:
- ✅ **Insertion 5** (Lines 132-147): Spec-first teaching
  - "Clarity first, implementation second"
  - Planning questions guide students
  - Example specification provided
  - Bridges to technical creation

**Status**: ✅ MODELED THROUGH SPEC-FIRST EXERCISE

---

### Core Philosophy: "Specs Are the New Syntax"
**Evidence**:
- ✅ **Insertion 5**: "Practice specification thinking—planning your subagent's purpose before you build it"
- ✅ Specification-writing emphasized as PRIMARY SKILL
- ✅ Example specification format demonstrated
- ✅ Students write spec BEFORE implementation

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION-WRITING PRIMARY SKILL TAUGHT

---

### Core Philosophy: Co-Learning Convergence
**Evidence**:

- ✅ **Insertion 3**: Shows AI adapting based on delegation mode preference
- ✅ **Insertion 6**: Students test, compare, build decision-making skills
- ✅ Bidirectional learning throughout (student learns from AI, AI learns from student)

**Status**: ✅ CO-LEARNING DEMONSTRATED ACROSS MULTIPLE TOUCHPOINTS
