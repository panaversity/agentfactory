**Type**: AI as Guide (teaches domain-specific vocabulary mapping)
**Purpose**: Make specification thinking personal and domain-aware
**Copyable Prompt**:
```
"I typically work on [domain]. Looking at the command reference table,
which 3-4 commands would I use MOST OFTEN in MY workflow? For each one,
give me a realistic example from my domain showing WHAT I'd specify
(not HOW I'd code it). Then tell me: which commands might I barely use? Why?"
```

**Learning Outcome**: Students discover that vocabulary is universal; usage is personal.

---

### 2. 🎓 Expert Insight: Checkpoints as Specification Markers (Lines 404-440)

**Type**: Strategic framing connecting practical tool to professional practice

## Specific Changes by Section

### Section 1: Introduction (Lines 9-30)

**Original**: "In Lesson 2, you installed Claude Code and saw it work for the first time. Now comes the crucial step: learning the commands you'll use every day to work efficiently with your AI pair programmer."

**Regenerated**: Complete rewrite with "Specification Verbs" framing
- Introduces commands as verbs in a specification language
- Explicit reference to Constitution Principle 3
- Connects to Lesson 1 (agentic) and Lesson 2 (partnership)

**Rationale**: Original introduction treated commands as technical features. Regenerated version frames them as the PRIMARY SKILL (specification articulation).

---

### Section 2: Command Reference Table Intro (Line 36)

**Original**: "These are the commands you'll use most often. Don't try to memorize them all at once—use this table as a reference, then practice in the hands-on section."

**Regenerated**: "Each command expresses a distinct specification intent. Use this table as a reference—don't memorize. The real skill is knowing when to use which intent, not memorizing syntax."

**Table Enhancement**: Added "Specification Intent" column showing WHAT each command means

**Rationale**: Shift from feature memorization to specification literacy.

---

### Section 3: NEW AI Colearning Prompt (Lines 54-74)

**Content**: Entirely new section
**Purpose**: Help students map commands to their domain

```

**Regenerated**:
```
What happens: Claude reads the file, analyzes the logic, and provides specific suggestions

Specification Mindset: When you start a conversation, you're not "using a tool"—you're
briefing a co-worker. Think: "What outcome do I want?" not "What commands should I type?"
Claude Code's agentic architecture (from Lesson 1) means you specify intent, and AI determines execution.
```

**Rationale**: Reinforces specification thinking at first occurrence of substantive command explanation.
