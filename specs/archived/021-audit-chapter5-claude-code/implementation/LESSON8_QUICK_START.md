## The 6 Insertions (In Order)

### 1️⃣ Extension Hierarchy Visualization (36 lines)
**Where**: After plugin definition, before "Plugins vs. Individual Extensions"
**What**: ASCII tree showing Commands → Subagents → Skills → Hooks → Plugins progression
**Why**: Scaffolds concept progression (Principle 13: Tiers 1-5)
**Key Concept**: "Tier 3 orchestration: AI manages complexity, you specify intent"

### 2️⃣ AI Colearning Prompt (5 lines)
**Where**: Within hierarchy subsection
**What**: Interactive prompt to explore orchestration benefits with your AI
**Why**: Practice specification thinking (Principle 2)
**Prompt**: "I work on [workflow]. Looking at the hierarchy, give me one example where PLUGIN would save time. Show before/after."

### 3️⃣ Three-Role Framework Expert Insight (27 lines)
**Where**: After all 4 built-in plugin descriptions
**What**: Complete breakdown of plugins demonstrating Three-Role AI Partnership
**Why**: Connects to Lesson 1 (Principle 18); shows plugins at peak efficiency
**Key Insight**: "Ambient intelligence—your AI partnership anticipates needs, coordinates specialists, delivers results"

### 4️⃣ Organizational Plugins Expert Insight (32 lines)
**Where**: After advanced hooks, before real workflow example
**What**: Positions custom plugins as strategic competitive organizational assets
**Why**: Shows business value of composition (Principle 13: Tier 3 organizational)
**Key Message**: "Your plugins = organizational knowledge captured as executable code"

### 5️⃣ Map Your Workflow Exercise (21 lines)
**Where**: Before "Creating Your Own Plugin" section
**What**: Specification-first practice (decompose workflow using extension hierarchy)
**Why**: Prepares students to think like plugin architect (Principle 2: Spec-First)
**Task**: Choose workflow → map to hierarchy → write orchestration logic

### 6️⃣ Test Built-In Plugin Exercise (24 lines)
**Where**: Before "Try With AI" section
**What**: Hands-on activity (enable, run, observe what triggers, reflect on manual vs. automated)
**Why**: Experience Tier 3 orchestration in action (Principle 13, Principle 8)
**Reflection**: "What would this look like WITHOUT plugin orchestration?"

## Deletion

### ❌ "What's Next" Section (18 lines)
**Why**: Violates AI-first closure policy (lesson must end with "Try With AI", no post-sections)
**Preservation**: Message about practicing tools reinforced in Try With AI Exercise 2

## Constitutional Alignment

### Principle 2: Specification-First Development
**Integration**: ✅ STRONG
- Insertions 1, 5 emphasize "specify intent, AI manages complexity"
- Practice exercises reinforce specification decomposition
- Hierarchy shows progression of composition complexity

### Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern (Tier 1→3)
**Integration**: ✅ STRONG
- 4 explicit Tier 3 references
- Shows foundational → complex → orchestration progression
- Exercises model Tier 3 thinking and practice
- "Plugins as Tier 3 orchestration" is primary learning outcome

### Principle 18: Three-Role AI Partnership
**Integration**: ✅ STRONG
- Insertion 3 maps all three roles to plugin architecture
- Shows Teacher/Student/Co-Worker operating simultaneously
- Colearning prompt demonstrates bidirectional learning

## Key Insights for Validators

1. **Hierarchy Visualization is Accessible**: ASCII tree with clear labels works well for grade 7-8 audience. Shows composition as natural progression, not confusing feature list.

2. **Three-Role Framework Resonates**: Connecting plugins to Lesson 1's Three-Role Framework gives students "aha moment"—plugins aren't just bundled features, they're AI partnerships at peak efficiency.

3. **Organizational Context Matters**: Beginner audiences engage with strategic/business framing (competitive advantage, knowledge capture, scaling). Makes technical concepts concrete.

4. **Practice Progression is Effective**: Map → Test → Apply mirrors Principle 13 (foundational → complex → orchestration). Students learn thinking patterns, not just using tools.

5. **CoLearning Diversity**: Mixing interactive prompts (AI asks questions), expert insights (human shares wisdom), and hands-on exercises (students experience) meets diverse learning preferences.

## Troubleshooting FAQ

**Q: Will the ASCII tree display correctly in Docusaurus?**
A: ASCII trees with proper indentation and backticks render correctly in most markdown processors. Test in local Docusaurus build to confirm.

**Q: Are the CoLearning prompts domain-specific?**
A: Intentionally domain-agnostic. Prompt says "I work on [YOUR WORKFLOW]" so students adapt to their context (web, DevOps, data, mobile, etc.).

**Q: Does removing "What's Next" break navigation?**
A: No. Docusaurus sidebar handles navigation. Message about "practice using tools" is reinforced in Try With AI Exercise 2.

**Q: Are all constitutional references verifiable?**
A: Yes. All Principle references point to actual constitution sections. Three-Role Framework references Lesson 1. Tier 3 references are in Principle 13. Forward preview (Part 9) aligns with chapter index.

**Q: Will students understand "ambient intelligence"?**
A: Context is provided. Explained as "anticipates needs, coordinates specialists, delivers results without you managing components." If unclear during validation, suggest simplifying to "smart coordination."

## Success Summary

This surgical edit achieves the core objective: **Preserve excellence while gaining constitutional alignment**.

Original lesson was already strong on plugin definitions and examples. Insertions add the "why" (strategic context), "how to think" (specification decomposition), and "learn by doing" (hands-on practice) that transforms good content into transformative content.

Preservation rate (87%) reflects surgical precision—minimal disruption, maximum impact.
