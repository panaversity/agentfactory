## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks (All Mitigated)

**Risk 1**: Tier 2/3 distinction confuses students
- **Mitigation**: Explicit framing + 80/20 rule + "Master 80% first"
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 2**: CoLearning elements feel disconnected
- **Mitigation**: Natural placement at content breakpoints + Clear labeling
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 3**: Fintech example too specialized
- **Mitigation**: Pattern clearly explained, applicable to any domain
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 4**: Try With AI prompts too domain-specific
- **Mitigation**: All prompts domain-agnostic with [your domain] template
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 5**: Increased content overwhelms learners
- **Mitigation**: Maintained 5-7 concepts/section, progressive scaffolding
- **Status**: MITIGATED
