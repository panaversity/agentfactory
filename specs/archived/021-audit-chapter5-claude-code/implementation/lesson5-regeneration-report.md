## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1**: Regenerated sections feel "bolted on" rather than integrated
- **Mitigation**: Each element flows naturally from preceding content
- **Verification**: Proof validator checks pedagogical flow
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 2**: Tier 2/3 distinction confuses beginners about when to build custom
- **Mitigation**: Explicit framing "Not required for Part 2" + 80/20 rule + "Master 80% first"
- **Verification**: Proof validator checks confidence in students NOT building custom
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 3**: CoLearning elements too numerous, overwhelming cognitive load
- **Mitigation**: Strategic placement at natural breakpoints + Clear labeling
- **Total elements**: 7 (consistent with Lesson 4 surgical edit)
- **Spacing**: Distributed across 9 sections (~1 element per 50 lines)
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 4**: Try With AI prompts too specialized for diverse domains
- **Mitigation**: All prompts domain-agnostic (tested against web, data, DevOps, security, mobile)
- **Template approach**: [your domain: ...] structure allows customization
- **Status**: MITIGATED

**Risk 5**: Fintech example too specialized, not relatable to all learners
- **Mitigation**: Example demonstrates pattern (expertise as automated asset) applicable to any domain
- **Additional context**: "Pattern" explained explicitly (line 92)
- **Status**: MITIGATED
