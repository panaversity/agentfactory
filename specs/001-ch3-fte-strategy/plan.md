# Chapter 3 Restructuring Plan: The Digital FTE Strategy
## Comprehensive Lesson-by-Lesson Implementation Plan

**Generated by**: chapter-planner v2.0.0 (Reasoning-Activated Constitution Mode)
**Source Spec**: specs/001-ch3-fte-strategy/spec.md
**Constitution**: v7.0.0 (Agent Factory Paradigm)
**Created**: 2025-12-25

## I. Executive Summary

This plan restructures Chapter 3 from "How to Make a Billion Dollars in the AI Era" to "The Digital FTE Strategy"—aligning with the Agent Factory paradigm established in Chapter 1.

**Key Changes**:
- **Removes** 4 sections overlapping Chapter 1 (market opportunity, Digital FTE concept, Five Powers)
- **Reframes** 6 existing lessons through monetization and competitive strategy lenses
- **Adds** 3 new lessons (Monetization Part 1&2, When NOT to Use Agents)
- **Expands** from 8 to 11 lessons with justified cognitive load distribution
- **Maintains** 4-Layer pedagogical framework (Layer 1: Foundation, Layer 2: AI Collab, Layer 3: Intelligence, Layer 4: Spec-Driven)

**Pedagogical Rationale**:
- **8 core concepts** identified from spec (expertise positioning, competitive frameworks, monetization models, guardrails)
- **A2 proficiency tier** (building on Chapter 1 A1 foundations)
- **11 lessons justified** by concept density + cognitive load limits (A2 max 5-7 concepts per lesson)

## II. Chapter Analysis

### Chapter Type Classification
**Hybrid Conceptual + Strategy-Based** (no hands-on coding)

Teaching modality:
- Essay-style conceptual foundations (Lessons 1-2)
- Framework demonstrations with real-world examples (Lessons 3-9)
- Structured assessment and synthesis (Lessons 10-11)

### Assumed Knowledge (Callback to Chapter 1)
Students already understand:
- Agent Factory paradigm and vision (Chapter 1 Lesson 1)
- General Agents vs Custom Agents distinction (Chapter 1 Lesson 3)
- Digital FTE concept and value proposition (Chapter 1 Lesson 10)
- Spec-Driven Development fundamentals (Chapter 1 Lesson 9)
- AI amplification principle (Chapter 1)

### What Chapter 3 Teaches FROM SCRATCH
- How to position YOUR expertise as a Digital FTE product (not generic)
- Competitive strategy layers (Snakes & Ladders framework)
- Revenue economics comparing Digital FTE to human labor
- Agent Skills (SKILL.md) as monetizable intellectual property
- Four monetization models with selection criteria
- Piggyback-Protocol-Pivot market entry strategy

- When NOT to use AI agents (security, compliance, ethical guardrails)

### Proficiency Tier: A2 (Aspiring)
- Cognitive load limits: Max 5-7 new concepts per lesson
- Scaffolding level: Moderate (students know Agent Factory, need business framing)
- Bloom's level: Understand, Apply (recognize patterns, apply to own domain)
