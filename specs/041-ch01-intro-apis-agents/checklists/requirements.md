## Content Quality

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Learning objectives clearly stated | ✅ PASS | 4 learning objectives defined: explain APIs, distinguish LLM vs Agent, setup environment, visualize architecture |
| Pedagogically sound structure | ✅ PASS | Follows 4-Layer Teaching Method: Layer 1 (Manual Foundation) - concepts before code |
| Appropriate analogies provided | ✅ PASS | 4 analogies: restaurant (APIs), smart person in room (Agents), chef's station (environment), house blueprint (architecture) |
| Progressive complexity maintained | ✅ PASS | Cognitive load LOW - no agent code yet, concepts only |
| Cross-chapter integration documented | ✅ PASS | Section "Cross-Chapter Integration" maps Ch1 state to Ch2-16 dependencies |

## Requirement Completeness

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| All requirements testable and measurable | ✅ PASS | 26 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-026) - all have concrete verification criteria |
| Lesson outcomes concrete | ✅ PASS | Every lesson has explicit deliverable: working API key, comparison table, configured environment, architecture doc |
| Success criteria quantified | ✅ PASS | 10 success criteria with percentages (95% success rate, 90% completion without help, 80% within time range) |
| Edge cases identified | ✅ PASS | 5 edge cases documented with troubleshooting: network issues, invalid key, OS differences, Python version, firewall |

## Feature Readiness

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| User scenarios prioritized | ✅ PASS | 4 user stories with P1/P2/P3 priorities - API verification and environment setup are P1 (blockers) |
| Independent testability per story | ✅ PASS | Each user story has "Independent Test" section showing how to verify in isolation |
| Constraints explicit and comprehensive | ✅ PASS | 21 constraints across 4 categories: Technical (5), Pedagogical (7), Content Structure (5), Dependency (4) |
| Non-goals prevent scope creep | ✅ PASS | 10 excluded topics + 4 scope boundaries clearly defined |
| Dependencies mapped | ✅ PASS | Prerequisites (none - entry chapter), downstream (Ch2-16 gated), related features (platform gating, verification tool) |
