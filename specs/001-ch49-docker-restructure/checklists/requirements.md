- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Educational Content Specific

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section included
- [x] Proficiency level specified (B1)
- [x] Layer progression documented (L1 → L3 → L4)
- [x] Running example identified (Task API from Chapter 40)
