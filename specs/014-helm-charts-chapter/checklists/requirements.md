# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 51 — Helm Charts for AI Services

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Educational Content Quality (Chapter-Specific)

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section clearly defines prerequisites
- [x] Proficiency level specified (B1-B2)
- [x] Layer progression validated (L1 → L2 → L3/L4)
- [x] Chapter teaches AI-native thinking, not just tool mechanics
- [x] L1 lessons build vocabulary/mental models before AI collaboration
- [x] Chapter connects to Part 6 agent (throughout examples)
- [x] Differentiation from Chapter 50 Lesson 20 clearly articulated

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 stories with 24 acceptance scenarios)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (10 criteria)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully. Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.

### Notes

- Spec is comprehensive with 20 functional requirements covering structure, knowledge, practical, and quality aspects
- 8 user stories with clear priorities (P1/P2/P3) provide complete coverage
- 10 measurable success criteria enable objective validation
- Clear differentiation from Chapter 50 prevents content duplication
- Educational requirements (Assumed Knowledge, Layer progression) are well-defined
