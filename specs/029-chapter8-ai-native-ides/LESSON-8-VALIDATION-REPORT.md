**Verification**: Grep validation completed — 0 violations found

**Acceptable Pattern Examples Found**:
- "Notice Zed anticipated your needs..." (natural narrative)
- "What emerged from this iteration:" (outcome-focused)
- "Through dialogue, your code became..." (descriptive)
- "What Emerged from This Comparative Work:" (process-focused, not pedagogical)

**Status**: ✓ PASS - Framework entirely invisible, students EXPERIENCE collaboration

### Three Roles Demonstration (Layer 2) ✓

**Requirement**: Demonstrate all three roles through natural collaborative narrative

**Role 2: AI as Student** ✓
- Zed section: AI iterates on feedback ("Add error handling")
- Cursor section: AI adapts implementation based on .cursorrules
- Antigravity section: AI incorporates plan feedback before implementation

**Role 3: AI as Co-Worker** ✓

## Evals-First Alignment

**Chapter Success Criteria Mapping**:

From spec.md SC-005:
> "Students complete the comparative capstone activity by observing AI implement the same feature (temperature converter) in 2-3 different IDEs and produce a structured comparison (300+ words) analyzing AI output differences, IDE interaction patterns, response speed, and code quality"

**This lesson**:
- ✓ Implements Task Manager CLI (more complex than temperature converter)
- ✓ Builds in all 3 IDEs (exceeds 2-3 requirement)
- ✓ Structured analysis across 5 dimensions (exceeds comparison requirement)
- ✓ Try With AI prompts students to reflect 300+ words
- ✓ Analysis includes: workflow patterns, AI output quality, speed, autonomy, testing

**Additional Coverage**:
- LO-004: Applies selection criteria to 5 project scenarios
- LO-005: Compares IDEs through hands-on implementation
- LO-007: Evaluates AI output for quality and correctness

**Status**: ✓ PASS - Exceeds spec requirements

---

## Code Quality Validation

All code examples in lesson:
- ✓ Include type hints throughout
- ✓ Include docstrings (Google style)
- ✓ Include error handling
- ✓ Are syntactically correct Python
- ✓ Use pathlib for file operations
- ✓ Follow production patterns
- ✓ Are properly formatted and readable

**Example**: Task class implementation (lines 91-106)
```python
class Task:
    """Represents a single task with metadata."""

    def __init__(self, id: int, description: str, priority: str = "medium",
                 completed: bool = False, created_at: Optional[str] = None):
    ...
    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        """Convert task to dictionary for JSON serialization."""
```

**Status**: ✓ PASS - Production-grade code examples

---

## Pedagogical Quality Assessment

### Teaching Approach ✓
- **Strategy**: Experiential learning (build 3x, compare, synthesize)
- **Modality**: Hands-on implementation, comparative analysis, reflection
- **Progression**: Sequential building → systematic comparison → personal strategy
- **Engagement**: Real tools, real workflows, real decisions

### Difficulty Curve ✓
- Part 1 (Zed): Easy workflow, fast feedback
- Part 2 (Cursor): Medium complexity, more thinking upfront
- Part 3 (Antigravity): Most complex, planning-heavy
- Analysis: Reflection on what just experienced
- Strategy: Application to personal workflow

### Knowledge Accumulation ✓
- Students build with Tool A, compare Tool B against it
- Students understand Tool B's patterns, then see Tool C's different approach
- Comparative analysis builds on all three experiences
- Personal strategy requires synthesis of all learning

**Status**: ✓ PASS - Sound pedagogical structure
