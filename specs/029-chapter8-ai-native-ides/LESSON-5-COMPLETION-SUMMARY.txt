================================================================================
                          CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

✅ Meta-Commentary Prohibition (v6.0.1)
   → ZERO role labels exposed ("AI as Teacher", "What you learned", etc.)
   → All content uses action prompts ("Ask AI:", "Observe:", "Compare:")

✅ Three Roles Invisibly Demonstrated
   → AI as Teacher: Chat mode suggests patterns
   → AI as Student: Agent mode "Request Changes" feedback
   → AI as Co-Worker: .cursorrules convergence loops

✅ Observational Learning (Part 2 Requirement)
   → NO manual coding required (students haven't learned Python yet)
   → All activities: Prompt AI → evaluate → analyze → synthesize

✅ Evals-First Alignment (SC-005)
   → Mini-project: Same temperature converter as Zed Lesson 3
   → Reflection: 200+ word structured comparison
   → Section 6: Mode selection framework for analysis

✅ Layer 2 Teaching Framework
   → Clear progression: Chat → Agent → .cursorrules → Exercises
   → Observational loops demonstrating convergence
   → No exposition of pedagogical design

================================================================================
                            CONTENT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

CORE SECTIONS (6 sections, ~9,000 words):
  1. Chat Mode - Codebase-aware queries with @filename syntax
  2. Agent Mode - Autonomous multi-file changes with diff approval
  3. .cursorrules - Teaching AI about your project patterns
  4. Diff Review - Safety checkpoint and decision framework
  5. Extensions - VS Code ecosystem compatibility
  6. Mode Selection - When to use Chat vs Agent vs inline

EXERCISES (3 exercises, ~4,500 words):
  1. .cursorrules Teaching - Create rules, observe AI behavior change
  2. Chat vs Inline - Compare Chat and inline explanations
  3. Agent Workflow - Use Agent, review diffs, make decisions

ASSESSMENTS (2 items, ~2,000 words):
  1. Mini-Project - Build temperature converter (same as Zed)
  2. Reflection - Structured Zed vs Cursor comparison (SC-005 prep)

TRY WITH AI PROMPTS:
  ✅ 6 complete Try With AI sets (one per core section)
  ✅ All include: Setup, 3+ prompts, observations, expected outcomes
  ✅ Copyable and immediately usable

================================================================================
                         PEDAGOGICAL QUALITY
================================================================================

PROFICIENCY TIER: B1 (Intermediate, 7-10 concepts) ✅
  New concepts: 9
  - Chat mode, multi-turn conversations, @filename references
  - Agent mode, diff review, .cursorrules, mode selection
  - Extension compatibility, Request Changes workflow
  - Heavy scaffolding: step-by-step, decision matrices, real examples

LEARNING PROGRESSION: Chat → Agent → .cursorrules ✅
  → Each section builds on previous
  → Exercises demonstrate convergence
  → Mini-project integrates all learning
  → Reflection synthesizes comparison

LAYER 2 (AI COLLABORATION): ✅
  → AI as Teacher: Chat suggests patterns (Section 1)
  → AI as Student: Agent adapts to feedback (Section 2)
  → Student teaches AI: .cursorrules guidance (Section 3)
  → Convergence loops: Exercises 1-3

CONTEXT7 RESEARCH INTEGRATED: ✅
  → Chat mode patterns (context-aware editing)
  → Agent mode workflow (autonomy_and_safety)
  → .cursorrules examples (project_guidance)
  → Extension compatibility (ecosystem_notes)
  → Diff review (change_management)
