# Lesson 6: Installing Antigravity IDE

## Overview

Antigravity represents a fundamentally different approach to AI-native development. While Zed emphasizes speed and Cursor evolves the VS Code paradigm, Antigravity introduces an **agent control plane architecture**—where AI agents actively manage your development workflow through a unified three-surface system.

Launched publicly on November 18, 2025 (just days before this lesson was created), Antigravity represents Google DeepMind's vision for the future of developer tools. This lesson covers:

- Platform-specific installation (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Workspace creation and configuration
- AI provider setup (Google AI, Anthropic, OpenAI)
- The three core surfaces: Agent Manager, Editor, Integrated Browser
- Verification through your first agent creation

**Time estimate**: 60-75 minutes (accounts for a new product with occasional setup delays)

**Why Lesson 6?**: By this point, you've installed two traditional IDEs (Zed and Cursor). Antigravity introduces a different mental model—moving from "editor that helps you write code" to "AI agents that manage your development and you supervise." This shift requires fresh thinking about development workflows.

## What You'll Learn in This Lesson

This lesson is structured around **three core capabilities**:

1. **Installation mastery**: Get Antigravity running on your system without getting stuck
2. **Surface understanding**: Learn how Agent Manager, Editor, and Integrated Browser work together
3. **First agent experience**: Create and manage your first agent to see the paradigm in action

By the end, you'll have Antigravity installed, authenticated, and ready to explore agent-driven development in Lesson 7.
