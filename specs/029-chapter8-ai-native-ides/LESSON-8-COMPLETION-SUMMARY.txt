   - Success criteria clearly defined

2. Part 1: Building with Zed (Inline Workflow)
   - Time tracking setup
   - 4 step-by-step implementation phases
   - Natural collaborative narrative showing AI teaching
   - Iterative refinement patterns
   - Observation template for students

3. Part 2: Building with Cursor (Chat-Agent Workflow)
   - .cursorrules file creation for code style guidance
   - Complete specification writing
   - Chat interface + Agent mode workflow
   - Diff review and approval process
   - Plan feedback and refinement loop
   - Observation template for students

4. Part 3: Building with Antigravity (Plan-Artifact Workflow)
   - Agent spawning with full context
   - Task List artifact review and feedback
   - Implementation Plan guidance
   - Code review in Implementation artifact
   - Walkthrough artifact validation
   - Observation template for students

5. Comparative Analysis: Five Dimensions
   - Dimension 1: Development Speed
   - Dimension 2: Code Quality
   - Dimension 3: Learning Curve
   - Dimension 4: Autonomy Level
   - Dimension 5: Testing & Iteration
   - Student rating exercise (1-5 scale)

6. IDE Selection Decision Framework
   - 5 realistic project scenarios with clear recommendations
   - Scenario 1: Quick Prototype → Zed
   - Scenario 2: Refactor Existing → Cursor
   - Scenario 3: New Component → Antigravity
   - Scenario 4: Data Processing → Cursor
   - Scenario 5: Team Project → Antigravity

7. Creating Your Personal IDE Strategy
   - IDE Selection Matrix template
   - Primary/Secondary/Tertiary IDE choice
   - Workflow preferences section
   - IDE switching strategy
   - Areas to improve
   - Integration with existing tools
   - 30-day experiment plan

8. Key Outcomes from This Capstone
   - 6 core insights about AI-native development
   - Tool influence on thinking patterns
   - Decision-making as primary skill shift

9. Try With AI (Student Practice Activity)
   - 3 project options for student choice
   - 5-step implementation task
   - Documentation requirements
   - 300+ word reflection prompts
   - Success criteria
   - Optional challenge

================================================================================
CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE VALIDATION
================================================================================

Framework Invisibility (Layer 2):
  ✓ Zero meta-commentary violations
  ✓ Three Roles framework entirely invisible
  ✓ Students EXPERIENCE collaboration, not STUDY it
  ✓ No explicit role labels (AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker)

Three Roles Demonstration:
  ✓ AI as Teacher: IDE workflows show suggestion and innovation
  ✓ AI as Student: All IDEs adapt to student feedback/constraints
  ✓ AI as Co-Worker: Visible convergence through iteration loops

Evidence Requirement:
  ✓ All code examples have demonstrated output
  ✓ Zed: Manual testing shown
  ✓ Cursor: Test commands provided
  ✓ Antigravity: Walkthrough artifact shows expected behavior

Structural Compliance:
  ✓ Ends with "Try With AI" activity section
  ✓ No "What's Next" or meta-navigation after activity
  ✓ No pedagogical meta-commentary

Proficiency Alignment (B1):
  ✓ 10 new concepts (within B1 limit of 7-10)
  ✓ Moderate scaffolding (high-level guidance)
  ✓ Bloom's Apply/Analyze level
  ✓ Estimated time: 150-180 minutes (appropriate)

================================================================================
LEARNING OBJECTIVES COVERAGE
================================================================================

LO-1: Build same feature in 3 IDEs
  ✓ Task Manager CLI implemented across all three IDEs

LO-2: Compare across 5 dimensions
  ✓ Systematic comparison section with full analysis

LO-3: Develop selection criteria
  ✓ Decision framework with 5 realistic scenarios

LO-4: Create personal strategy
  ✓ Personal IDE Strategy template provided

LO-5: Evaluate strengths/limitations
  ✓ Key Outcomes section + comparative analysis

================================================================================
EVALS-FIRST ALIGNMENT
================================================================================

Chapter Success Criteria (SC-005):
  Requirement: Students complete comparative capstone by observing AI
  implement same feature in 2-3 IDEs and produce structured comparison
  (300+ words) analyzing AI output differences, IDE patterns, speed, quality

  This Lesson:
  ✓ Builds Task Manager CLI in all 3 IDEs (exceeds requirement)
  ✓ Structured analysis across 5 dimensions (exceeds requirement)
  ✓ Try With AI requires 300+ word reflection
  ✓ Analysis includes: workflow patterns, AI quality, speed, autonomy
