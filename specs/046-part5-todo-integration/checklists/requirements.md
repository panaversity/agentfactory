# Specification Quality Checklist: Part 5 Todo Running Example Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Educational Content Quality

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section present and complete
- [x] Proficiency level specified (A2 → B2)
- [x] Chapter teaches transferable patterns (via auxiliary examples)
- [x] Connection to downstream content (Part 6) documented

## Notes

**Validation Status**: PASSED

All items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.

Key strengths:
1. Clear priority ordering (P1: OOP + Capstones, P2: Category B/C, P3: Category D + Connections)
2. Measurable success criteria tied to audit categories
3. Explicit scope boundaries (Part 5 only, examples only)
4. Edge cases addressed (pedagogically superior examples kept, Todo fatigue mitigation)

**Next Step**: Proceed to `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan.
