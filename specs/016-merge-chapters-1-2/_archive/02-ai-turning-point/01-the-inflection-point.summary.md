### Core Concept
2025 is a genuine inflection point—not hype—because three independent trends converge simultaneously: AI capability breakthroughs (perfect scores in elite competitions), mainstream developer adoption (84% using AI tools, 51% daily), and enterprise productization (billion-dollar acquisitions, not pilots).

### Key Mental Models
- **Convergent Validation**: When academic benchmarks, industry surveys, and financial decisions all point the same direction, you're seeing signal, not noise
- **Inflection vs. Incremental**: Exponential capability jumps (15% → 49% benchmark scores in 18 months) indicate paradigm shift, not gradual improvement
- **Follow the Money**: Multi-billion dollar acquisitions by conservative enterprises reveal market signals that predictions cannot

### Critical Patterns
- Evaluate AI claims by source independence: vendor demos vs. academic competitions vs. third-party research
- Check adoption data from multiple angles: usage rates, daily frequency, time spent (2 hours/day median)
- Assess enterprise confidence through financial commitments, not announcements

### Common Mistakes
- Dismissing all AI capability claims as coordinated hype—look for independent validation instead
- Waiting for "perfect timing" when majority adoption (51% daily) has already happened
- Confusing single impressive demos with convergent evidence from academia, surveys, and acquisitions
