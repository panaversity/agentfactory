### Core Concept
Traditional CS education remains valuable for foundational theory, but it's no longer sufficient—universities teach on a 2-4 year revision cycle while AI tools evolve every 3-6 months, creating a widening gap between what's taught and what's needed.

### Key Mental Models
- **Curriculum Lag**: University approval cycles (2-4 years) vs. AI evolution cycles (3-6 months) means curricula are always outdated by graduation
- **Necessary But Insufficient**: CS foundations (algorithms, data structures, architecture) are essential—but must be supplemented with AI-native skills
- **Hybrid Advantage**: Combining traditional CS depth with modern AI practices creates the strongest developer profile

### Critical Patterns
- Five critical gaps: AI collaboration, spec-driven development, agent orchestration, MCP protocols, real-world problem solving
- Self-taught learners are no longer disadvantaged—skills that matter most aren't taught in universities anyway
- Use AI to help bridge theory-to-production gap that universities can't address

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking you must complete traditional CS education before learning AI-native development—learn both simultaneously
- Dismissing university education entirely—foundational theory remains valuable
- Waiting for curricula to catch up—the gap will only widen
