### Core Concept
AI is transforming the **entire** software development lifecycle—not just code writing. Every phase (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, operations) is being reshaped, and improvements in one phase compound through all subsequent phases.

### Key Mental Models
- **Code as Regenerable Artifact**: Code becomes temporary; specifications, architectural decisions, and domain expertise become the durable assets you invest in
- **Lifecycle Compression**: AI doesn't eliminate development phases—it compresses them. The sequence stays; the speed changes
- **Compounding Effect**: Better planning → better architecture → easier implementation → fewer bugs → smoother deployments → reduced operational burden

### Critical Patterns
- Six lifecycle phases: Planning → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Operations
- AI augments each phase differently: requirements analysis, architecture alternatives, code generation, test suite generation, infrastructure configuration, predictive monitoring
- Role convergence: boundaries between developer, QA, and DevOps are blurring—individual contributors can now handle multiple phases
- Your value shifts from "typing speed" to design quality and code review rigor

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking AI coding tools only help with "writing code" (missing the full lifecycle transformation)
- Focusing on mechanical implementation skills instead of judgment and strategic decision-making
- Believing specialist roles disappear entirely (they converge; high-level expertise becomes MORE valuable)
