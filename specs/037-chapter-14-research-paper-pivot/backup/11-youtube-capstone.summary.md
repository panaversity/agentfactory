### Core Concept
Intelligence accumulation is measurable: Lesson 1-8 video generation from scratch = 3.5 hours; Lesson 11 YouTube upload using skills = 70 minutes; future projects compound faster (Project 3 approaches 40 minutes), proving reusable intelligence accelerates exponentially.

### Key Mental Models
- **Specification complexity reduction**: YouTube spec (15 min) is simpler than video spec (45 min) because upstream complexity encapsulated in skill
- **Skill composition**: Not "start from scratch," but "invoke existing skills with new constraints"
- **Portfolio evidence**: Time comparison proves intelligence ROI (show both timelines to prospective employers: "I created a library of reasoning patterns that accelerated this 70% time reduction")
- **Compounding returns**: Each skill refinement + new skill addition + project experience → velocity increases multiplicatively

### Critical Patterns
- **Simplified specification**: Only describes WHAT success looks like (video on YouTube, plays correctly), not HOW skill works internally
- **Skill references explicit**: `/sp.implement --skills generate-video,upload-youtube` tells AI to apply pre-built reasoning
- **Validation checklist**: Pre-upload (file exists, auth ready, metadata accurate) + post-upload (URL accessible, plays completely, metadata visible)
- **Time tracking**: Document both timelines (scratch vs. with skills) to prove acceleration and plan for future projects

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Skills encode patterns → AI reasoning accelerates without re-discovery
- Specification remains contract between human intent and AI execution
- Checkpoint control maintained (approval before publishing, validation after)

### Common Mistakes
- **Attributing success to AI alone**: "AI did the upload" instead of "I specified what success looks like, skills encoded patterns, AI executed within my framework"
- **Skipping reflection**: Uploading the video but not measuring why it was faster (missing learning opportunity)
- **Not documenting skill benefits**: Timeline evidence should be saved (future reference, career portfolio, teaching others)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All previous lessons (Spec, Plan, Tasks, Implement, Intelligence Design create foundation)
- **Demonstrates**: Full SDD-RI cycle working in practice (theory → implementation → reusable intelligence → accelerated execution)
- **Projects forward**: Pattern for every future project (accumulate skills → solve problems faster → compound velocity)
