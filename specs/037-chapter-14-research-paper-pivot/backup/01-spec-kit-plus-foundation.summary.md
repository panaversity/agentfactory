### Core Concept
Spec-Kit Plus captures reusable intelligence (not just code) through two architectures: Horizontal Intelligence flows reasoning patterns across time (ADRs, PHRs), while Vertical Intelligence distributes specialized decision-making through subagents (Persona+Questions+Principles). Intelligence compounds—Project 1 teaches lessons that Project 10 inherits.

### Key Mental Models
- **Ephemeral Code vs Permanent Intelligence**: Code may be rewritten, but reasoning patterns (why you chose Playwright MCP, what prompts work) persist across projects
- **Horizontal = Time, Vertical = Hierarchy**: Horizontal flows left-right across projects; Vertical flows top-down from you through specialized subagents
- **Intelligence Compounding**: Each project adds ADRs/PHRs that subsequent projects read, making Project 10 dramatically faster than Project 1

### Critical Patterns
- **ADRs document "WHY"**: Record the reasoning behind significant architectural choices so future projects understand context
- **PHRs log what works**: Capture which prompts succeed and fail, creating a searchable playbook for future AI collaboration
- **Subagents embody expertise**: Design specialized agents (P+Q+P pattern) that apply domain knowledge systematically rather than answering ad-hoc questions
- **P+Q+P activation**: Persona defines cognitive stance, Questions guide reasoning, Principles establish evaluation criteria

### Common Mistakes
- Treating ADRs/PHRs as documentation for humans only—they're decision logs that AI agents actually READ and apply
- Creating generic subagents ("helpful assistant") instead of specialized ones with video production expertise, for example
- Assuming intelligence is project-specific—in reality, authentication patterns discovered in Project 2 inform video generation in Project 5
