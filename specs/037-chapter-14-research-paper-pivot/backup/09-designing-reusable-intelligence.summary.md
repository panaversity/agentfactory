### Core Concept
Intelligence encoding transforms recurring workflow patterns (5+ decision points, 3+ project frequency, organizational value) into reusable Persona+Questions+Principles skills that compound across projects.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skills over code**: Traditional development reuses functions; AI-native development reuses reasoning frameworks (Persona establishes thinking stance, Questions activate analysis, Principles provide decision rules)
- **Skill vs. subagent**: Skill = focused reasoning pattern (15-50 lines, 5-7 questions); Subagent = autonomous reasoning system (orchestrates multiple skills)
- **Pattern frequency threshold**: If pattern appears 1-2 times, keep tacit; 3+ times, encode as skill (ROI of encoding effort)
- **P+Q+P activation**: Vague persona ("you are expert") triggers prediction mode (generic responses); specific persona ("director ensuring cinematography quality") triggers reasoning mode (context-aware analysis)

### Critical Patterns
- **Persona design**: Establish cognitive stance through analogy, not title (not "video expert," but "video producer who thinks like director ensuring consistent cinematography")
- **Open-ended questions**: Force analysis across multiple dimensions ("Does narrative explain value?" + "Is pacing consistent?" + "Do all gates pass?") vs. yes/no ("Is this good?")
- **Objective quality gates**: Measurable criteria (Gate 1: File > 0 bytes, Gate 2: MP4 H.264, Gate 3: 45-60 sec) instead of subjective (looks fine)
- **Reusability: generalize not specialize**: "Video-Generation-Quality-Validation" works for SaaS + tools + tutorials; "Calculator-Demo-Video" only works for calculators

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use `/sp.loopflow` to design Persona interactively (iterate toward effective cognitive stance)
- Collaborative skill design: You provide domain context, AI helps articulate decision frameworks
- Skills amplify human judgment (AI reasons within decision framework you designed)

### Common Mistakes
- **Encoding trivial patterns**: Creating skill for "invoke Gemini" (1 decision) when skills need 5+ decision complexity
- **Vague personas**: "Video expert" (generic) instead of specific cognitive stance that activates reasoning
- **Binary questions**: "Is video good?" instead of "Does narrative explain value? Is pacing consistent? Do gates pass?"
- **Over-specific skills**: "Marketing-Video-Skill-For-SaaS" instead of generalizable "Video-Quality-Framework"

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Implementation (Lesson 8) discovers patterns worth encoding; tasks reveal decision points
- **Leads to**: Skill reuse (Lesson 11) demonstrates that accumulated intelligence accelerates future projects
- **Critical for**: Exponential velocity increase (Project 1: 3.5 hrs build, Project 2: 1 hr reuse, Project 3: 45 min refined)
