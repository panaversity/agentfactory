# Quickstart – Chapter 31 Practice Flow

1) Read the spec
- Path: ../002-redesign-ch31-specifyplus/spec.md
- Confirm users, scope, acceptance scenarios.

2) Review and collect gaps
- Use the spec to identify ambiguities and list them in a “gaps log”.
- Target ≥5 gaps on first pass.

3) Resolve unknowns in research
- Edit research.md and record decisions, rationale, alternatives.
- Resolve calculator scope, feedback mode, and tooling reference.

4) Align design artifacts
- Update data-model.md based on decisions.
- Ensure contracts/openapi.yaml matches acceptance scenarios.

5) Validate readiness
- All critical gaps resolved.
- Acceptance scenarios trace to requirements and contracts.

6) Proceed to planning tasks
- Once readiness is confirmed, generate tasks from the refined spec and plan.
