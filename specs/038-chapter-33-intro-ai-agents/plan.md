**Platform**: Docusaurus 3.9.2
**Delivery**: **8 lesson markdown files** (~18,000 words) + 10-12 visual diagrams

**Key Frameworks from Paper** (MUST teach):
1. **5-Level Taxonomy**: Level 0 (Core Reasoning) → Level 4 (Self-Evolving System)
2. **3+1 Architecture**: Model ("Brain") + Tools ("Hands") + Orchestration ("Nervous System") + Deployment ("Body")
3. **5-Step Operational Loop**: Get Mission → Scan Scene → Think → Act → Observe
4. **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Coordinator, Sequential, Iterative Refinement, HITL

6. **Agent Interoperability**: A2A protocol, Agent Cards, agent identity as principal

**Pedagogical Approach**:
- **Layer 1 Primary** (Lessons 1-3): Direct teaching of definitions, architecture, process
- **Layer 2 Integration** (Lessons 4-7): AI collaboration through "Try With AI" prompts
- **Layer 3 Synthesis** (Lesson 8): Students design conceptual agent specifications

**Success Metrics**: Students understand 5-Level Taxonomy, 3+1 Architecture, 5-Step Loop, 4 patterns, Agent Ops basics, A2A protocol, framework landscape, and can design a conceptual agent specification.

## Technical Context

**Content Type**: Educational book chapter (Markdown)
**Platform**: Docusaurus 3.9.2 (static site generation)
**No code dependencies**: Conceptual-only content (no Python, no SDKs)

**Testing Approach**: Content validation checklist (anti-convergence, citations, pedagogy, CEFR cognitive load)

---

## Constitution Check

**GATE 1: Pedagogical Layer Alignment** ✅ PASSED
- Layer 1 Primary (Lessons 1-2): Manual foundation before AI collaboration
- Layer 2 Integration (Lessons 3-5): AI collaboration through "Try With AI" actions
- Layer 3 Synthesis (Lesson 6): Specification design
- No skipping stages (no spec-first in Layer 1)
- Three Roles framework INVISIBLE (action-based, not exposition)

**GATE 2: Constitutional Principles Compliance** ✅ PASSED
- Specification Primacy: Chapter teaches mental models before frameworks (intent before implementation)
- Progressive Complexity: B1 proficiency tier, cognitive load <10 concepts per lesson
- Coherent Structure: Lessons build cumulatively (agency → components → patterns → frameworks → partnership → application)
- Intelligence Accumulation: Chapter 33 provides conceptual foundation for Chapter 34 SDK implementation
- Anti-Convergence: Varied teaching modalities, production-relevant examples, no generic patterns

**GATE 3: Meta-Commentary Prohibition** ✅ PASSED
- No role labels in student-facing content (Three Roles framework invisible)
- "Try With AI" sections use action prompts only ("Ask your AI:", "Observe:", "Reflect:")
- No exposition of pedagogical scaffolding ("What to notice: AI is teaching you..." forbidden)
- Framework stays invisible; students experience co-learning through actions

## Context for Content-Implementer

**CRITICAL: PRIMARY SOURCE**:
The Google/Kaggle "Introduction to Agents" whitepaper (November 2025) is the **authoritative source** for ALL frameworks taught in this chapter. DO NOT deviate from paper's terminology or frameworks.

**Key Requirements**:

   - **5-Step Loop**: Get Mission → Scan Scene → Think Through → Take Action → Observe and Iterate
   - **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Coordinator, Sequential, Iterative Refinement, HITL
   - **Agent Ops**: LM-as-Judge, Golden Datasets, OpenTelemetry Traces, Human Feedback Loop
   - **Interoperability**: A2A Protocol, Agent Cards, Task-Oriented Architecture
   - **Security**: Agent Identity as Principal, Trust Trade-Off, Defense in Depth
   - **Paradigm Shift**: "Director vs Bricklayer"

6. **Research Foundation**:
