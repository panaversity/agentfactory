## Cognitive Load Distribution

```
Lesson  | Concepts | Count | Proficiency | Load        | Engagement
--------|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------
L1      | 3 types  | 3     | A2          | Light       | Demystification
L2      | 2 types  | 2     | A2          | Light       | First success
L3      | 3 types  | 3     | A2          | Light-Mod   | Knowledge building
L4      | 3 types  | 3     | A2-B1       | Light-Mod   | Organization
L5      | 2 types  | 2     | A2-B1       | Mod-Peak    | Interactivity
L6      | 0 types  | 0     | A2-B1       | Integration | Mastery synthesis
--------|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------
TOTAL   | 9 cores  | 13    | A2→B1       | 2.2 avg     | Progressive

✅ ALL within A2 limit (5-7 concepts per lesson)
✅ Progressive increase (early light, late moderate)
✅ Peak at L5 (interactivity = high engagement)
✅ L6 pure synthesis (no cognitive load, all validation)
```

---

## WHAT-WHY-HOW Pattern Applied to All Lessons

```
LESSON STRUCTURE TEMPLATE (Applies to L1-L5; L6 is synthesis)

1. STORY HOOK (2-3 min)
   └─ Connection to previous lesson + narrative element

2. WHAT IS [CONCEPT]? (8-10 min)
   └─ Definition + analogy, NO CODE YET
   └─ Build mental model

3. WHY [CONCEPT] MATTERS (6-8 min)
   └─ Purpose, real-world relevance
   └─ Why computer/programmer needs this

4. CONCEPTUAL BUILDING (5-8 min)
   └─ Memory diagrams, frameworks, supporting structure
   └─ Deep understanding before syntax

5. NOW SHOW CODE (8-10 min)
   └─ Syntax appears AFTER understanding established
   └─ Code demonstrates concept, doesn't introduce it

6. PRACTICE EXERCISES (5-10 min)
   └─ Simple to complex progression
   └─ Validation checkpoints

7. COMMON MISTAKES (3-5 min)
   └─ Friendly guidance for predictable errors
   └─ Error message explanations

8. TRY WITH AI (3-5 min)
   └─ Practice prompts (not solution generation)
   └─ AI as partner, not solver

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TOTAL LESSON: 40-50 minutes (scaffolded for A2 learners)
```

---

## Story Continuity Check

```
L1: What is programming?
    └─ Robot sandwich analogy: programming = giving instructions

L2: First program (print)
    └─ "Robot speaks" - robot's first words (Hello World)
    └─ BUILDS ON: L1 understanding of instructions

L3: Variables
    └─ "Robot remembers" - robot has memory
    └─ BUILDS ON: L2 (robot now needs to remember things)
    └─ ANALOGY: Pet naming (same metaphor family)

L4: Type hints
    └─ "Robot organizes" - classifying data
    └─ BUILDS ON: L3 (robot has memory, now must organize it)
    └─ ANALOGY: Library organization (parallel metaphor)

L5: User input
    └─ "Robot listens" - two-way communication
    └─ BUILDS ON: L4 (robot receives & classifies user data)
    └─ COMPLETES: Basic interactive program capability

L6: Capstone
    └─ "Robot introduces itself" - uses all skills
    └─ SYNTHESIS: All concepts in one program
    └─ NARRATIVE: Robot's complete journey from L1
```

## Teaching Modality: Story-Based vs Analogy-Based

```
CHAPTER 13 (This Chapter)          vs    CHAPTER 14 (Data Types)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Story-Based Narrative Journey          Analogy-Based Classification

Opening: "Robot sandwich"              Opening: "Kitchen jars"
Flow: Unfolding narrative              Flow: Organized taxonomy
Structure: Arc with rising action      Structure: Categories + properties
Metaphor: Single (robot consistent)   Metaphor: Multiple (jars, filing, etc)
Engagement: "I'm on a journey"        Engagement: "I'm learning a system"
Progression: Sequential discovery     Progression: Systematic learning
Resolution: Capstone synthesis         Resolution: All types mastered
```

**Key Distinction**: These are genuinely different pedagogical approaches, not duplicates.

## A2 Cognitive Load Compliance

```
Proficiency Limit: CEFR A2 (Beginner)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Max 5-7 NEW concepts per lesson
   L1: 3 ✓  L2: 2 ✓  L3: 3 ✓  L4: 3 ✓  L5: 2 ✓  L6: 0 ✓

✅ Heavy scaffolding (step-by-step with checkpoints)
   All lessons: WHAT-WHY-HOW pattern applied

✅ Max 2 options when choices presented
   No overwhelming decision-making

✅ Define EVERY term (assume zero knowledge)
   Especially in L1-L2

✅ Real-world examples (not abstract)
   Ages, names, hobbies—not x, y, z

✅ Pacing appropriate (30-45 min per lesson)
   Not rushed, not tedious

COMPLIANCE: 100% ✓
```

## Anti-Pattern Prevention Checklist

```
AVOID: ❌                      INSTEAD USE: ✅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Lecture-style facts           Story-based narrative
"10 facts about Python"       "Robot learning journey"

Topic taxonomy                Narrative arc
"Lesson 1: History"           "Lesson 1: What is programming"

Syntax-first teaching         WHAT-WHY-HOW sequence
"Here's print()"             "Here's why print() exists..."

Scaffolding exposed           Pedagogy hidden
"Stage 1 focus"              Students experience learning
"Layer 1 manual"             (don't study teaching method)

Arbitrary lesson count        Justified by concept density
"9 lessons" (template)       "6 lessons" (analysis-driven)

Duplicate modality            Teaching modality variation
Same as Ch 14                Story vs Analogy (different)

## Quick Validation Checklist

```
BEFORE CALLING IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:

Story & Narrative
  ☐ Chapter is narrative journey (not topic list)
  ☐ Robot metaphor consistent throughout
  ☐ Story continuity between lessons (each builds on previous)
  ☐ Capstone resolves narrative arc (not standalone project)

Pedagogy
  ☐ WHAT-WHY-HOW applied consistently (no syntax-first)
  ☐ Scaffolding hidden (Stage 1 invisible to students)
  ☐ Teaching modality differs from Ch 14 (story vs analogy)
  ☐ "For Curious Learners" sections optional (don't interrupt)

Content
  ☐ All code executes (Python 3.14+, test logs present)
  ☐ All claims cited (Python.org references)
  ☐ Real-world examples (not abstract)
  ☐ Type hints in every example (normalize practice)

Cognitive Load
  ☐ L1: ≤7 concepts (actual: 3) ✓
  ☐ L2: ≤7 concepts (actual: 2) ✓
  ☐ L3: ≤7 concepts (actual: 3) ✓
  ☐ L4: ≤7 concepts (actual: 3) ✓
  ☐ L5: ≤7 concepts (actual: 2) ✓
  ☐ L6: ≤7 concepts (actual: 0) ✓

Anti-Patterns
  ☐ Zero "Stage [0-9]" in student text (grep validation)
  ☐ Zero "Layer [0-9]" in student text (grep validation)
  ☐ No "What's Next" after "Try With AI" (section ordering)
  ☐ No meta-commentary (avoid studying learning method)

Success Criteria
  ☐ All EV/SC mapped to lesson content
  ☐ Lesson count justified (6, not arbitrary)
  ☐ Stage progression clear (L1-L5 Stage 1, Try With AI bridge)
  ☐ Capstone synthesis evident (0 new concepts, all integration)
```

## Key Decision Summary

| What | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Lesson Count | 6 (not 9) | Concept density analysis + A2 heavy scaffolding |
| Narrative | Robot story | Engagement + demystification for beginners |
| Modality | Story-based | Differs from Ch 14's analogy-based approach |
| Stage | Stage 1 only | Foundation before AI collaboration (Ch 14+) |
| Progression | Light→Moderate→Integration | Progressive cognitive load matching A2 limits |
| Capstone | 0 new concepts | Synthesis validates mastery, doesn't teach new |
| "Try With AI" | Not Stage 2 | Bridge only; Stage 2 deferred to Ch 14 |

---

**Status**: Plan complete. Ready for `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation tasks and `/sp.implement` to create lesson content.
