# Chapter 7 Bash Essentials — Lesson-by-Lesson Refinement Plan

**Generated by**: chapter-planner v2.0.0 (Reasoning-Activated)
**Branch**: `030-chapter-7-bash-refinement` | **Date**: 2025-11-17
**Spec**: specs/030-chapter-7-bash-refinement/spec.md
**Constitution Version**: v6.0.0 (Reasoning Mode)
**Orchestrator**: LoopFlow Spec→Plan Transition
**Quality Standard**: Constitutional Compliance First (Surgical Corrections)

---

## Summary

Surgical constitutional compliance refinement of Chapter 7 (Bash Essentials) addressing 7 violations (2 critical structural, 5 minor whitespace) discovered in audit 2025-01-17. Strategy: fix critical violations (Lessons 2, 8) → normalize whitespace (Lessons 3-7) → enhance Three Roles clarity for A2 learners (all Stage 2 lessons). No content rewrites; only structural moves + light narration. Target: 100% compliance (up from 87.5%).

## Technical Context

**Content Type**: Educational chapter refinement (8 markdown lesson files)
**Primary Tool**: Docusaurus + Markdown
**Storage**: book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/07-bash-essentials/
**Testing**: Grep-based constitutional validation + manual review
**Target Audience**: A2-tier learners (beginner, Parts 1-3)
**Project Type**: Educational content (distributed across 8 lesson files)
**Performance Goals**: Zero constitutional violations, 100% compliance
**Constraints**: No content rewriting (surgical moves only), <10% word count variation per lesson
**Scale/Scope**: 8 lesson files, ~4000 total lines, 87.5%→100% compliance journey

## Refinement Strategy

### Sequencing Decision: Critical-First with Validation Checkpoints

**Rationale**: Address structural violations (P1) by critical severity BEFORE minor violations (P2). Early validation checkpoints catch regressions and enable incremental quality gates.

```
Phase 1 (Critical Fixes - 4-6 hours):
├─ Lesson 2 (CRITICAL): Move Real Examples content INTO Try With AI section
└─ Lesson 8 (CRITICAL): Move closing paragraphs INTO Try With AI section
   → VALIDATION CHECKPOINT 1: Verify structural compliance

Phase 2 (Minor Fixes - 1-2 hours):
├─ Lessons 3-7: Normalize whitespace (trailing newlines)
└─ All lessons: Verify no unintended content movements
   → VALIDATION CHECKPOINT 2: Verify whitespace clean

Phase 3 (Enhancement - 4-6 hours):
├─ Lessons 3-8: Add Three Roles narration markers (A2-appropriate light touch)
└─ All lessons: Final compliance audit
   → VALIDATION CHECKPOINT 3: Constitutional compliance audit (100% passing)
```

**Total Timeline**: 2-3 working days (9-14 hours implementation + 3-4 hours validation)

---

## Constitutional Alignment

**Applicable Principles**:
- **Principle 7 (Minimal Content)**: Single closure section ("Try With AI" only), no forbidden sections
- **Section IIa (Stage 2 - Three Roles)**: AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker demonstrated through narrative
- **Principle 2 (Progressive Complexity)**: A2 tier (5-7 concepts, heavy scaffolding, max 2 options)
- **Principle 6 (Anti-Convergence)**: Dialogue-first hands-on discovery (already implemented correctly)

**Violations to Fix**:

| Lesson | Violation Type | Constitutional Principle | Severity |
|--------|---|---|---|
| 1 | None | N/A | ✅ Pass |
| 2 | Content after "Try With AI" section | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P1 Critical |
| 3 | Excessive trailing whitespace | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P2 Minor |
| 4 | Excessive trailing whitespace | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P2 Minor |
| 5 | Excessive trailing whitespace | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P2 Minor |
| 6 | Excessive trailing whitespace | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P2 Minor |
| 7 | Excessive trailing whitespace | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P2 Minor |
| 8 | Content after "Try With AI" section | Principle 7 (Minimal Content) | P1 Critical |

## Lesson-Specific Implementation Plan

### Lesson 1: Introducing Your AI Workspace

**Compliance Status**: ✅ Fully Compliant

**Corrections Needed**: NONE (No changes required)

**Rationale**: Final section is "Try With AI," no forbidden sections present, no scaffolding exposed, whitespace normalized.

**Validation**: Confirm during final audit only.

**Estimated Duration**: 0 minutes

---

### Lesson 2: The Safety-First Dialogue Pattern

**Compliance Status**: ❌ CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Violation Details**:
- **Lines 413-419**: "## Try With AI: Real Examples from Gemini" section header + intro
- **Lines 420-503**: REAL EXAMPLES 1-3, "Your Task," "Key Insight" (content OUTSIDE section)
- **Lines 504-505**: Blank lines + EOF
- **Constitutional Issue**: Content appears after "Try With AI" section, creating two closure areas

**Correction Approach**: SURGICAL MOVE

1. **Identify**: Lines 420-503 (Real Examples 1-3 + Your Task + Key Insight)
2. **Move**: Into "## Try With AI" section as subsections
3. **Format**: As ### subsections (Real Example 1, Real Example 2, Real Example 3, Your Task)
4. **Preserve**: All dialogue text verbatim (no paraphrasing)
5. **Finalize**: Single final "---" marks lesson end

**Three Roles Enhancement** (Stage 2):
- **Real Example 1 (Backup)**: Gemini teaches git approach, you validate—add "Notice how Gemini taught you about git snapshots..."
- **Real Example 2 (Delete)**: You teach Gemini definition of "old"—add "Here you taught Gemini..."
- **Real Example 3 (File org)**: Convergence on real solution—add "This shows real co-learning..."
- **Pattern**: 1-2 sentences max per marker, observational tone ("Notice how...", "Here you...", "Through...")

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check final section
tail -50 02-safety-first-pattern.md | grep -E "^## " | tail -1
# Expected: "## Try With AI: Real Examples from Gemini"

# Check no forbidden sections
awk '/^## Try With AI/,0' 02-safety-first-pattern.md | grep -E "^## (What's Next|Key Takeaways|Summary|Safety Note)"
# Expected: Zero matches
```

**Content Preservation Check**: Word count <5% variation (only Three Roles narration added)

**Estimated Duration**: 60-90 minutes

---

### Lessons 3-7: Understanding Navigation, File Operations, Configuration, Packages, Pipes

**Compliance Status**: ⚠️ MINOR VIOLATION (All lessons)

**Violation Details** (identical pattern across all 5 lessons):
- Final section correct ("## Try With AI: [topic]")
- Structure compliant (no forbidden sections)
- **Issue**: Extra blank lines after final "---" section marker
- **Constitutional Issue**: Principle 7 requires clean structure with exactly 1 blank line after final section

**Correction Approach**: WHITESPACE NORMALIZATION

1. **For each lesson (03-07)**:
   - Verify final "---" appears after Try With AI content
   - Remove ALL trailing newlines beyond single blank line
   - Ensure pattern: `---\n\n[EOF]` (exactly 1 blank line after "---")

**Three Roles Enhancement** (Stage 2, for each lesson):
- **Identify**: Strongest dialogue example in Try With AI section
- **Add**: 1-2 sentence observational marker showing bidirectional learning
- **Tone**: "Notice how...", "Here you...", "Together you..."
- **Frequency**: 2-3 markers per lesson (not every example)

**Per-Lesson Narration Guidance**:
- **Lesson 3 (Navigation)**: Add after navigation dialogue—"Notice how you and AI navigated toward the same goal, demonstrating co-learning..."
- **Lesson 4 (File Ops)**: Add after file operation example—"Here you verified each step, teaching AI about your risk tolerance..."
- **Lesson 5 (Configuration)**: Add after secrets example—"Notice how AI suggested security patterns while learning your storage approach..."
- **Lesson 6 (Packages)**: Add after dependency example—"Together you converged on the optimal dependency configuration..."
- **Lesson 7 (Pipes)**: Add after pipeline example—"Here AI suggested the pattern while you validated the output, demonstrating orchestration..."

**Validation**:
```bash
# Whitespace check
for lesson in 03 04 05 06 07; do
  tail -c 20 "/path/to/${lesson}-*.md" | od -c
done
# Expected: "---\n\n" (no trailing whitespace, EOF immediately after second newline)
```

**Estimated Duration**: 30-45 minutes per lesson (4 lessons × 40 min = ~160 minutes = 2.5 hours)

---

### Lesson 8: Real Project Setup and Troubleshooting (Capstone)

**Compliance Status**: ❌ CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Violation Details**:
- **Lines 564**: "## Try With AI: Orchestration at Scale (Advanced)" section header
- **Lines 565-602**: Section content (practice exercise, what to expect)
- **Lines 603-605**: CLOSING PARAGRAPHS (content OUTSIDE section)
  - "You can now supervise sophisticated bash workflows..."
  - "This is the foundation of productive collaboration..."
- **Lines 607-609**: Extra blank lines + EOF
- **Constitutional Issue**: Content appears after "Try With AI" section, creating dual closure

**Correction Approach**: SURGICAL MOVE

1. **Identify**: Lines 603-605 (closing paragraphs)
2. **Move**: Into "## Try With AI" section, after "What to Expect" subsection
3. **Format**: As concluding remarks within Try With AI section
4. **Preserve**: Closing paragraphs word-for-word (no alteration)
5. **Finalize**: Single final "---" marks lesson end

**Three Roles Enhancement** (Stage 2, Capstone pattern):
- **Where**: In project orchestration section
- **What**: Add 2-3 markers showing full co-learning cycle
- **Example**: "Throughout setup, notice how you and AI took turns: You specified intent, AI suggested workflow (teaching), you executed and reported results, AI refined based on feedback (learning). The solution that emerged was better than either could design alone."
- **Pattern**: Emphasize iteration and convergence as capstone theme

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check final section
tail -50 08-real-project-troubleshooting.md | grep -E "^## " | tail -1
# Expected: "## Try With AI: Orchestration at Scale (Advanced)"

# Check no content after
awk '/^## Try With AI: Orchestration/,0' 08-real-project-troubleshooting.md | grep -E "^## (What's Next|Key Takeaways|Summary|Safety Note)"
# Expected: Zero matches
```

**Content Preservation Check**: Word count <5% variation (only Three Roles narration added)

**Estimated Duration**: 60-90 minutes

## Three Roles Integration Framework

### Principle: Light Touch, A2-Appropriate Language

**Core insight**: Three Roles markers should be visible for learners seeking clarity, invisible for fluent readers. Avoid condescension.

**Forbidden language**:
- ❌ "This is Stage 2 demonstrating Three Roles"
- ❌ "## Three Roles in Action"
- ❌ "Layer 2 collaboration pattern"
- ❌ "You are now experiencing bidirectional learning"

**Encouraged language**:
- ✅ "Notice how [AI action] taught you..."
- ✅ "Here you taught AI that..."
- ✅ "Through [N] iterations, you and AI converged on..."
- ✅ "Together you figured out the real solution"

### Narration Templates (by Role Type)

**Template 1: AI as Teacher (Optimization)**
```
"Notice how [AI suggested pattern]. This teaches you that [learning value]—
a real example of how AI collaboration surfaces approaches you might not have considered."
```

**Template 2: Student as Teacher (Constraint)**
```
"Here, you taught [AI] that [constraint]. This demonstrates active supervision—
you're not passively accepting AI's answer, you're guiding it toward YOUR actual needs."
```

**Template 3: Convergence (Iteration)**
```
"Through [description of iteration], you and AI converged on [solution].
Neither had the perfect answer at the start—co-learning is what produced the result."
```

**Template 4: Capstone Pattern (Full Cycle)**
```
"Throughout [task], notice how you and AI took turns: You specified intent, AI suggested approach,
you executed and reported back, AI refined based on feedback. The solution that emerged was better than
either of you could have designed alone."
```

### Specific Markers by Lesson

**Lesson 2** (After Real Examples):
1. Example 1: "Notice how Gemini taught you about git's snapshot approach..."
2. Example 2: "Here, you taught Gemini what 'old' means in your context..."
3. Example 3: "This shows real co-learning: agent identified limitation, you learned..."

**Lesson 3**: Pick 1-2 navigation examples
- "Notice how you and AI navigated toward the same goal..."

**Lesson 4**: Pick 1-2 file operation examples
- "Here you verified each step, teaching AI about risk tolerance..."

**Lesson 5**: Pick 1-2 secrets/configuration examples
- "Notice how AI suggested security patterns while learning your approach..."

**Lesson 6**: Pick 1-2 dependency examples
- "Together you converged on optimal dependency configuration..."

**Lesson 7**: Pick 1-2 pipeline examples
- "Here AI suggested the pattern while you validated output, demonstrating orchestration..."

**Lesson 8**: In orchestration section
- "Throughout setup, notice the iteration: You specified, AI suggested, you executed and reported, AI refined..."

## Content Preservation Verification

### Red Flags (DO NOT PROCEED if you see these)

```
❌ REWRITTEN TEXT
- Original: "Gemini asked to run commands"
- Found: "The AI suggested running the commands"
→ This is paraphrasing (forbidden). Use exact text.

❌ REMOVED EXAMPLES
- Original: Three Real Examples present
- Found: Consolidated to one "combined" example
→ This alters pedagogy (forbidden). Preserve all examples.

❌ ALTERED STRUCTURE
- Original: ### Real Example 1, ### Real Example 2, ### Real Example 3
- Found: Single section "Examples (condensed)"
→ This changes learning progression (forbidden). Keep structure exact.

❌ CONTENT DRIFT
- Original: 500 words in Try With AI section
- Found: 250 words in Try With AI section
→ Content was removed (forbidden). Verify nothing deleted.
```

### Per-Lesson Diff Expectations

**Lesson 1**: Zero diff (no changes)
```
< Same file as original
```

**Lesson 2**: Structural moves only + Three Roles narration
```
- Lines 420-503 appear outside "Try With AI"
+ Lines 420-503 appear inside "Try With AI"
+ "Notice how Gemini taught you..." (new narration)
+ "Here you taught Gemini..." (new narration)
+ "This shows real co-learning..." (new narration)
[All dialogue text identical]
```

**Lessons 3-7**: Whitespace cleanup + Three Roles narration
```
- [Extra blank lines after "---"]
+ [Exactly 1 blank line after "---"]
+ "Notice how you and AI..." (new narration)
[Content text unchanged]
```

**Lesson 8**: Structural moves + Three Roles narration
```
- Lines 603-605 appear outside "Try With AI"
+ Lines 603-605 appear inside "Try With AI"
+ "Throughout setup, notice..." (new narration)
[All closing text identical]
```

## Git Workflow & Commit Strategy

**Commits organized by logical phases (not individual lessons), enabling rollback at phase boundaries.**

```bash
# Phase 1: Critical structural fixes
git commit -m "fix(chapter-7): Move content into Try With AI sections (Lessons 2, 8)

- Lesson 2: Move Real Examples 1-3 + Your Task + Key Insight into Try With AI section
- Lesson 8: Move closing paragraphs into Try With AI section
- Resolves constitutional violations (Principle 7: Minimal Content)
- Preserves all content verbatim, only reorganizes structure
- Enables Checkpoint 1 validation"

# Phase 2: Whitespace normalization
git commit -m "fix(chapter-7): Normalize trailing whitespace (Lessons 3-7)

- Remove excessive blank lines after final '---' section marker
- Ensure consistent pattern: exactly one blank line after final section
- Maintains constitutional compliance (clean structure)
- Enables Checkpoint 2 validation"

- Add 2-3 observational markers per Stage 2 lesson
- Highlights AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker roles
- Maintains light touch: <200 words total per lesson
- No pedagogical scaffolding exposed (student-facing content)
- Improves clarity for A2 learners without overwhelming"

# Final: Validation confirmation
git commit -m "test(chapter-7): Constitutional compliance audit - 100% passing

- All 8 lessons pass structural validation (final section = Try With AI)
- All 8 lessons pass forbidden section check (zero matches)
- All 8 lessons pass scaffolding check (no exposed pedagogy)
- Compliance score: 100% (up from 87.5%)
- Closes issue: 030-chapter-7-bash-refinement"
```

   - Task 1.2: Execute Lesson 8 structural move (lines 603-605 into Try With AI)
   - Validation: Run Checkpoint 1 script, confirm 4/4 checks passing
   - If any check fails, debug before proceeding to Phase 2

2. **Phase 2** (Minor):
   - Task 2.1: Normalize whitespace on Lessons 3-7 (exactly 1 blank line after "---")
   - Validation: Run Checkpoint 2 script, confirm all lessons pass
   - If any lesson fails, re-check whitespace pattern before proceeding to Phase 3

3. **Phase 3** (Enhancement):
   - Task 3.1: Add Three Roles narration to Lessons 2, 8 (2-3 markers each)
   - Task 3.2: Add Three Roles narration to Lessons 3-7 (1-2 markers each)
   - Validation: Run Checkpoint 3 script, confirm 24/24 checks passing
   - If any check fails, investigate before committing

4. **Finalization**:
   - Create git commits per Phase (3 commits total)
   - Push branch for validation-auditor review
   - Await approval before merge to main
