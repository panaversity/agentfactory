  Write Lesson 3 for Chapter 33: "The Agentic Problem-Solving Process"
  
  FILE PATH: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/storage/book-source/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/33-introduction-to-ai-agents/03-agentic-problem-solving-process.md`
  
  CRITICAL: Align with Google's "Introduction to Agents" whitepaper (November 2025)
  
  Paper Source: "The Agentic Problem-Solving Process" section with Customer Support Agent example
  
  Learning Objectives:
  - LO3.1: Recite and explain the 5-Step Operational Loop
  - LO3.2: Trace through paper's Customer Support example
  - LO3.3: Apply loop to new scenarios
  
  Content Structure (2,500-3,000 words):
  1. Universal Pattern Hook
  2. 5-Step Operational Loop (Get Mission, Scan Scene, Think, Act, Observe)
  3. Paper's Customer Support Example (Order #12345, tracking ZYX987)
  4. Context Engineering (Paper's key insight)
  5. Try With AI sections

response_text: |
  Completed Lesson 3 for Chapter 33 with full constitutional alignment.
  
  Key deliverables:
  1. Lesson file (3,311 words) at `/book-source/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/33-introduction-to-ai-agents/03-agentic-problem-solving-process.md`
  2. Verification report at `/specs/038-chapter-33-intro-ai-agents/LESSON-3-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md`
  
  Content highlights:
  - 5-Step Operational Loop explained with clear examples (Get Mission → Scan Scene → Think → Act → Observe)
  - Customer Support example traced exactly as per paper (Order #12345, tracking ZYX987, two-iteration loop)
  - Context Engineering introduced as critical insight: "An agent's accuracy depends on a focused, high-quality context"
  - Layer 1→2 transition: Manual foundation + AI exploration via "Try With AI" scenarios
  - Four practice scenarios: Coffee Shop Agent, Context Engineering Comparison, Custom Problem, Stretch Challenge
  
  Constitutional compliance:
  - Zero meta-commentary (no role labels, no "What you learned" statements)
  - Framework invisible to students
  - Proficiency alignment: 2 new concepts within B1 limit (7-10 concepts max)
  - Scaffolding: Moderate (concepts explained → examples → application)
  - Production-relevant examples (customer service, code refactoring, data analysis agents)
  - All content maps to learning objectives (evals-first)
  - Ends with action section only ("Try With AI")

context: |
  Chapter 33 is foundational conceptual chapter on AI agents (Part 6: AI Native Software Development).
  Students have completed Parts 1-5 (AIDD mindset, SDD-RI, Python fundamentals).
  Proficiency: B1 (Intermediate) — can handle 7-10 concepts with moderate scaffolding.
  
  Lesson 1 (completed): Definition, 5-Level Taxonomy, "director vs bricklayer" paradigm
  Lesson 2 (completed): 3+1 Core Architecture (Model, Tools, Orchestration, Deployment)
  Lesson 3 (this): 5-Step Operational Loop with Customer Support example walkthrough
  Lessons 4+: Multi-agent patterns, Agent Ops, interoperability, SDK landscape, capstone
  
  Primary source: Google/Kaggle "Introduction to Agents" whitepaper (November 2025)
  Canonical example: Customer Support Agent finding Order #12345 (tracking ZYX987)
  
  Layer progression: L1 (Manual Foundation) → L2 (AI Collaboration) transition
  - L1: Explain loop conceptually with clear manual walkthrough
  - L2: "Try With AI" invites exploration (framework invisible)
