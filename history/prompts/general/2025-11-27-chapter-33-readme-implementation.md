## Prompt History Record (PHR)

### Task Context

- **Objective**: Write Chapter 33 README.md for Part 6: AI Native Software Development
- **Chapter Position**: 33 of 91 chapters; first chapter of Part 6 (Agent development)
- **Chapter Type**: Conceptual (establishes mental models for agent development)
- **Proficiency Level**: B1+ (Intermediate/Advanced)

### Pre-Generation Context Gathering

1. Read chapter-index.md to confirm Chapter 33 position and prerequisites
2. Analyzed Chapter 33 pedagogical layer: Layer 1 (manual foundation) transitioning to Layer 2
3. Confirmed conceptual chapter approach: no code implementations, preparation for Chapters 34-36
4. Verified part structure and prerequisite alignment with Parts 1-5

### Content Requirements (Delivered)

1. **Frontmatter**: sidebar_position, title, description (YAML)
2. **Chapter Overview** (~200 words): Context, mental models, connection to hands-on work
3. **What You'll Learn**: 6 learning objectives with Bloom's verbs
4. **Prerequisites**: Clear pathway from Parts 1-5
5. **Industry Statistics**: Properly attributed (OpenAI, McKinsey, GitHub)
6. **Lesson Index**: Table showing 6 lessons with focus areas and cognitive levels
7. **Learning Path**: Time estimates (4-6 hours) with segmented approach
8. **What's Next**: Bridge to Chapter 34 OpenAI Agents SDK implementation

### Pedagogical Decisions

- **No code examples**: Appropriate for conceptual chapter; code comes in Chapter 34
- **No Key Takeaways section**: Only appropriate for individual lessons, not chapter README
- **Production-relevant framing**: Statistics on agent adoption, career implications, $2.9T opportunity
- **Constitutional compliance**: No meta-commentary, no pedagogical framework exposure to students
- **Mental model focus**: Agents vs chatbots, architectures (ReAct, Plan-Execute, Multi-Agent, Human-in-Loop), SDKs, partnerships

### Quality Validation

- All 10 sections complete and aligned
- Statistics with inline attribution (OpenAI, McKinsey, GitHub)
- Learning objectives span Bloom's levels (Distinguish through Design)
- Clear prerequisite pathway from previous parts
- Professional, engaging narrative tone
- Chapter structure matches book pedagogy (conceptual → practical progression)

### Commit Details

- **File**: apps/learn-app/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/33-introduction-to-ai-agents/README.md
- **Line count**: 121 lines
- **Status**: Merged to feature branch 038-chapter-33-intro-ai-agents
- **Commit hash**: 005d013

### Learning Applied

- Constitutional compliance (Section IIa on meta-commentary, Section 0 on persona)
- Chapter type adaptation (conceptual vs technical approaches)
- Layer recognition (L1 foundation before L2 collaboration)
- Pedagogical framing (mental models before implementation)
- Statistics attribution practices (inline citations for credibility)

### Artifacts Generated

- `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/storage/apps/learn-app/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/33-introduction-to-ai-agents/README.md` (121 lines)

### Task Completion

✓ All requirements met
✓ Constitutional compliance verified
✓ Pedagogical alignment confirmed
✓ Git commit completed
✓ Ready for lesson implementation (T011-T016)
