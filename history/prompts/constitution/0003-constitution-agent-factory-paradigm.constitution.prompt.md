## Prompt

Now let's update our constitution given the focus in new slides vision and preface and thesis

## Response snapshot

Updated constitution from v6.0.1 to v7.0.0 (MAJOR version bump) to align with Agent Factory paradigm:

### Key Changes:
1. **Title**: "AI Native Software Development Book" → "The AI Agent Factory"
2. **Preamble**: Reframed around Agent Factory thesis with $650M Casetext proof point
3. **NEW Section I**: "The Agent Factory Thesis" with Two Paths Framework
4. **NEW Section Ia**: "The Digital FTE Vision" - monetization framework
5. **NEW Section Ib**: "The AI Amplification Principle" - Vibe Coding vs SDD contrast
6. **Enhanced Three Roles**: Now shows bidirectional human-AI partnership
7. **Layer 4 outcome**: Changed from "Production project" to "Sellable Digital FTE"
8. **NEW Self-Monitoring Check**: "Vibe Coding Detection Check"

### Core New Concepts:
- **Two Paths Framework**: General Agents BUILD Custom Agents
- **Digital FTE**: Custom Agents packaged for monetization
- **Five Powers**: See, Hear, Reason, Act, Remember
- **Four Monetization Models**: Subscription, Success Fee, License, Marketplace
- **AI Amplification**: AI magnifies both good and bad habits
- **Vibe Coding**: Explicit anti-pattern (development by feel without specs)

## Outcome

- Impact: MAJOR - Complete paradigm reframe for all future content
- Tests: n/a (governance document)
- Files: 1 file (~2000 lines)
- Next prompts: Update templates if needed, align chapter-index.md terminology
- Reflection: Constitution now explicitly orients all content toward Digital FTE production

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean integration of new concepts
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment: Validate CLAUDE.md auto-updated with Agent Factory language
