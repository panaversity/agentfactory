## Prompt

/sp.plan 001-claude-agent-sdk

Context: Creating implementation plan for Chapter 36 Claude Agent SDK after comprehensive spec was created with all 8 unique features.

Key inputs:
- Spec: specs/001-claude-agent-sdk/spec.md (16 lessons, 31 FRs, 12 user stories)
- Constitution: .specify/memory/constitution.md (v7.0.0 with Agent Factory paradigm)
- Skill: .claude/skills/building-with-claude-agent-sdk

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan with:
- 5-phase pedagogical arc (Foundation → Application → Intelligence → Validation → Mastery)
- 15 lessons + capstone quiz mapped to 4-layer progression (L1→L2→L3→L4)
- 6 teaching modalities (anti-convergence validated)
- 8 unique features with prominence levels (★★★ for 4 critical differentiators)
- Cognitive load distribution (B1-B2 tier, ~100 concepts)
- Intelligence accumulation (8 reusable artifacts for future chapters)
- Constitutional alignment (all 7 principles validated)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan ready for /sp.tasks
- 🧪 Tests: Constitutional alignment validated
- 📁 Files: plan.md (236 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks 001-claude-agent-sdk
- 🧠 Reflection: chapter-planner subagent produced comprehensive pedagogical arc with proper layer transitions
