## Prompt

We need to a new Chapter @book-source\docs\02-AI-Tool-Landscape\08-ai-native-ides\ for AI-Native IDEs. The summary of this chapter is available @book-source\docs\02-AI-Tool-Landscape\08-ai-native-ides\README.md . The context for antigravity google's IDE is @context\16_chapter8__ides . Use context7 mcp server for research and then create specs.

## Response snapshot

**Executed workflow**:
1. Context gathering: Read existing Chapter 8 README, Anti-gravity research notes, Part 2 overview
2. Research phase: Used Context7 MCP server to fetch documentation for:
   - Zed IDE (/zed-industries/zed, /websites/zed_dev): AI configuration, installation, collaboration features
   - Cursor IDE (/getcursor/docs): Chat mode, Agent mode, .cursorrules, tab completion
   - Anti-gravity (context/16_chapter8__ides/antigravity.md): Google DeepMind beta product analysis
3. Feature branch creation: Created 029-chapter8-ai-native-ides (next available number after highest global 034)
4. Specification writing: Comprehensive 470-line spec following template covering:
   - 7 prioritized user stories (P1-P7) with 25+ acceptance scenarios
   - 28 functional requirements across 6 categories
   - 8 success criteria (measurable outcomes)
   - 7 learning objectives mapped to success criteria
   - Extensive constraints, dependencies, risks/mitigations, out-of-scope sections
   - Research appendix documenting Context7 findings
5. Validation: spec-architect agent identified CRITICAL evals-first violation
6. Fix applied: Restructured document to place Success Criteria + Learning Objectives BEFORE User Scenarios (constitutional compliance)

**Final deliverables**:
- Complete educational chapter specification ready for planning phase
- Quality checklist auto-generated (24/28 items passing)
- Feature branch checked out and ready for next phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Chapter 8 specification created with comprehensive coverage of AI-native IDEs (Zed, Cursor, Anti-gravity), validated against constitutional principles
- 🧪 Tests: Educational validation via spec-architect (7.5/10 readiness score, evals-first issue fixed)
- 📁 Files: specs/029-chapter8-ai-native-ides/spec.md (470 lines), checklists/requirements.md (auto-generated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan (generate implementation plan), /sp.tasks (break down into actionable tasks)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied evals-first pattern after agent feedback; Context7 MCP research provided strong foundation for technical accuracy; 7-lesson structure maps naturally to user story progression

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial spec violated evals-first constitutional requirement (success criteria placed after user scenarios instead of before); corrected via document restructuring
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): spec-architect validation PASS after fix (was NEEDS_FIXES before evals-first correction)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify with Context7 MCP research integration
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding measurement rubrics for qualitative outcomes (SC feedback from spec-architect)
