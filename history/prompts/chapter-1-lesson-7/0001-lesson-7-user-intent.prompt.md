# Content Implementation: Lesson 7 — User Intent Replaces User Interface

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create Lesson 7 for the Agent Factory Paradigm chapter.

**Output Path**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/storage/apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-agent-factory-paradigm/07-user-intent-replaces-user-interface.md`

**EXECUTE AUTONOMOUSLY - DO NOT ASK FOR CONFIRMATION**

**Source**: Keep mostly intact from Ch2-L02 (User Interface to User Intent)

**Requirements**:
- YAML frontmatter with: title, chapter: 1, lesson: 7, duration_minutes: 20, sidebar_position: 7
- Include skills metadata block (proficiency A1-A2, Bloom's Understand/Apply)
- Embed video: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/yq-IhPszMpM`
- Content covers:
  - **Old paradigm**: User → Interface → Action (14 manual steps example)
  - **New paradigm**: User Intent → Agent → Orchestrated Actions (3 exchanges)
  - **The Five Powers**:
    1. **See** - Visual understanding (screenshots, diagrams)
    2. **Hear** - Audio/voice processing
    3. **Reason** - Planning and decision-making
    4. **Act** - Execute commands, write files
    5. **Remember** - Context retention, learning
  - How combined powers enable autonomous orchestration
  - Agentic AI evolution: Predictive → Generative → Agentic
- Learning objective: "Understand the UX→Intent paradigm shift and how five AI capabilities combine for autonomous agents"
- Include "Try With AI" section with 2-3 prompts (NO meta-commentary)
- Cognitive load: 5 concepts
- ~20 min reading time

Write the complete lesson file.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Completed autonomous lesson creation for Chapter 1, Lesson 7: "User Intent Replaces User Interface"

**File Created**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/storage/apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-agent-factory-paradigm/07-user-intent-replaces-user-interface.md`

**Content Summary**:
- 318 lines of markdown content
- 6 major sections (YAML + 5 content sections + Try With AI)
- Ends correctly with "## Try With AI" as final section (no Summary, Key Takeaways, or other forbidden endings)

**Constitutional Validation PASS**:
✓ Layer 1 (Manual Foundation) — Direct teaching of concepts before interactive exercises
✓ Zero meta-commentary patterns — No "What to notice", "AI as Teacher", "Three Roles" exposed
✓ Zero forbidden ending sections — Lesson ends with "Try With AI" only
✓ Cognitive load check — 5 core concepts (UX paradigm, Five Powers framework, AI evolution, skill shift, intent modeling) within A1-A2 limit of 5-7
✓ Three Roles implicit — "Try With AI" creates co-learning through prompts without exposing framework labels
✓ Specification pattern — "Try With AI" sections emphasize intent modeling and specification thinking

**Key Content Decisions**:
1. Adapted source material (Ch2-L02) while adjusting for Chapter 1 context
2. Kept hotel booking example (relatable, concrete)
3. Five Powers explained with clear emoji labels for memorability
4. Added "AI Evolution" section (Predictive→Generative→Agentic) to contextualize paradigm shift
5. "Try With AI" provides 3 active prompts (no commentary frames, pure action-oriented exploration)
6. Skill shift table removed from final version (was in source) — moved skill discussion to narrative to reduce cognitive load at A1-A2 level

**Concepts Mapped**:
1. User Interface paradigm (prescriptive, manual navigation)
2. User Intent paradigm (conversational, adaptive)
3. Five Powers framework (See, Hear, Reason, Act, Remember)
4. Orchestration (combined powers enabling autonomous action)
5. AI evolution phases (Predictive→Generative→Agentic)

**Cross-Book Intelligence**:
- Foundations for Chapter 2 (Turning Point) which builds on this intent-driven thinking
- Establishes mental model for Lesson 3 (Two Paths) agent discussion
- Primes students for Layer 2 AI collaboration sections in later chapters
