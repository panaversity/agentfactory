## Prompt

/sp.plan (continuation from Phase B of /sp.chapter workflow)

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation plan for Chapter 35: Building Reliable Agents with Google ADK.

**Plan Structure (497 lines, 14 sections)**:
1. Executive Summary - Three Pillars framework, Digital FTE outcome
2. Technical Context - Python 3.11+, google-adk, pytest, Vertex AI
3. Constitution Alignment - v7.0.0 Agent Factory paradigm verified
4. Lesson Architecture - 8 lessons, 16 core concepts
5. Detailed Lesson Structure - Full breakdown with learning objectives
6. Pedagogical Arc - Foundation -> Application -> Integration -> Mastery
7. Three Roles Framework - INVISIBLE implementation (action prompts only)
8. Skills Library - 6 skills created, composed in capstone
9. Cognitive Load Distribution - B1 tier compliance verified
10. Teaching Modality Variation - 8 distinct modalities (anti-convergence)
11. Assessment Strategy - Formative + summative rubrics
12. Content Quality Standards - Code testing, API verification protocols
13. Implementation Handoff - Clear instructions for all validators
14. References - Source materials and fact-checking protocol

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- 8 lessons (concept-density justified, not arbitrary)
- Evaluation-first from Lesson 1, used throughout
- Three Pillars organize content: Testable -> Predictable -> Safe
- Layer progression: L1 (Lesson 1) -> L2 (2-5) -> L3 (6-7) -> L4 (8 Capstone)
- 6 skills created and composed in capstone (intelligence accumulation)

## Outcome

- Impact: Implementation plan complete with clear pedagogical direction
- Tests: Constitution alignment passed, layer progression verified
- Files: plan.md created (497 lines)
- Next prompts: /sp.tasks for task generation, then /sp.implement
- Reflection: chapter-planner subagent produced high-quality plan aligned with reliability focus

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - plan follows Three Pillars framework from revised spec
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all constitution checks passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks
