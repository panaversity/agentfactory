## What We've Done

✅ **Completed**:
1. Comprehensive audit of all Chapter 2 images
2. Identified 6 images needing refinement
3. Researched and verified all statistics against authoritative sources
4. Created corrected prompts with:
   - 60-90% text reduction
   - Fixed spelling errors ("Orchestrator", "autonomously")
   - Correct frameworks (Five Powers: See/Hear/Reason/Act/Remember)
   - Larger, more readable text
   - Minimal, focused content

✅ **Verified Accurate** (no changes needed):
- `stack-evolution-2024-to-2025.png`
- `three-layer-ai-development-stack.png`

## Next Steps

1. Generate all 6 images using prompts above
2. Replace existing images in `book-source/static/img/part-1/chapter-2/`
3. Verify images display correctly in Docusaurus
4. Test build: `npm run build` (from book-source directory)
5. Mark audit as RESOLVED

## Summary

**Problem**: 6 out of 10 Chapter 2 images had issues (spelling errors, wrong frameworks, text too small)

**Solution**: Created minimal-text corrected prompts ready for immediate regeneration

**Impact**: Once regenerated, Chapter 2 will have 100% accurate, readable, high-quality visual assets aligned with lesson content

**Time to fix**: ~15 minutes to generate all 6 images in Gemini
