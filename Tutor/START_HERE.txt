🧠 TUTORGPT PROJECT - START HERE
==============================================

Hi! I need your help building TutorGPT - an autonomous AI tutor agent.

📂 Repository: https://github.com/MustafaAgentBuilder/ai-native-software-development
📁 Project Directory: Tutor/

🎯 YOUR MISSION:
1. Read ONBOARDING_PROMPT.md (full instructions)
2. Analyze entire repository
3. Read all design documents (spec, plan, research, tasks)
4. Identify gaps, mistakes, or improvements
5. Help me code the implementation

⚠️ CRITICAL: This is AGENT-FIRST architecture, NOT a static RAG pipeline!

📚 KEY DOCUMENTS TO READ (in order):
1. Tutor/.specify/memory/constitution.md - Project principles
2. Tutor/CLAUDE.md - Development process
3. Tutor/specs/001-tutorgpt-mvp/spec.md - What we're building
4. Tutor/specs/001-tutorgpt-mvp/research.md - Tech research (47KB)
5. Tutor/specs/001-tutorgpt-mvp/plan.md - Architecture (33KB)
6. Tutor/specs/001-tutorgpt-mvp/tasks.md - 205 tasks (33KB)
7. Tutor/specs/001-tutorgpt-mvp/data-model.md - Database & models
8. Tutor/specs/001-tutorgpt-mvp/quickstart.md - Dev setup
9. Tutor/ONBOARDING_PROMPT.md - FULL INSTRUCTIONS

🧠 AGENT-FIRST PHILOSOPHY:
TutorGPT Agent = Brain (makes decisions)
12 Tools = Capabilities (agent chooses when to use)
Supporting Services = Infrastructure (supports agent's tools)

The agent autonomously decides:
- When to search the book vs explain directly
- When to provide examples vs analogies
- When to quiz students vs continue teaching
- When to slow down or speed up
- When to celebrate progress

❌ DON'T: Build static pipeline with hardcoded logic
✅ DO: Build autonomous agent with decision-making intelligence

📊 PROJECT STATS:
- 205 tasks organized by agent capabilities
- 12 autonomous tools for teaching
- 107 book lessons to teach from
- Tech: FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Gemini, ChromaDB, ChatKit

🚀 AFTER READING, PROVIDE:
1. Summary of what TutorGPT is
2. Your understanding of agent-first architecture
3. Analysis: what's good, what's missing, what needs fixing
4. Questions before we start coding
5. Recommended first task to implement

READ ONBOARDING_PROMPT.md FOR COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS!

Let's build an autonomous AI tutor together! 🔥
