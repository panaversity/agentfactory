# AI Native Software Development: Colearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript – The AI & Spec Driven Way — Project Constitution

**Version:** 3.0.0 | **Ratified:** 2025-10-31 | **Last Amended:** 2025-10-31

---

## I. Project Vision & Philosophy

### Vision

"AI Native Software Development: Colearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript – The AI & Spec Driven Way" is a 55-chapter technical book that teaches AI-native software development methodology where specification-writing is the primary skill and AI agents handle implementation.

This book demonstrates how to build production-ready AI systems by:
1. **Thinking in Specifications** — Decomposing problems into clear, testable requirements
2. **Collaborating with AI** — Using Claude Code, Gemini CLI as co-reasoning partners
3. **Validating Outputs** — Testing and verifying AI-generated code systematically
4. **Deploying at Scale** — Production deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud-native patterns

**The Paradigm Shift**: In AI-native development, your ability to articulate intent clearly (specification) is MORE valuable than your ability to type syntax manually. The developer's role transforms from "code writer" to "specification designer and output validator."

This book progresses from AI-native mindset (Parts 1-3) through bilingual full-stack development (Python reasoning + TypeScript interaction) to production deployment with containers, orchestration, databases, and stateful agent systems (Parts 10-13).

### Core Philosophy

1. **Specification-First Development**
   Planning is THE primary skill. Clear specifications → AI generates implementation → Human validates. The developer's job is strategic thinking and verification, not manual typing. In AI-native workflows, specification quality directly determines output quality.

2. **AI as Co-Reasoning Partner**
   AI agents are collaborative partners in THINKING, not just coding assistants. They help refine specifications, suggest architectures, generate implementations, explain tradeoffs, and validate approaches. This book teaches readers to collaborate with AI as an equal partner in problem-solving.

3. **Validation-First Safety**
   Never trust, always verify. All AI-generated code must be read, understood, tested, and validated before use. Validation skills are as important as specification skills. Professional developers validate everything: syntax, types, security, functionality, and spec alignment.

4. **Bilingual Full-Stack Development**
   Professional AI-native developers are fluent in both Python (reasoning/backend) and TypeScript (interaction/frontend). Modern AI systems require both: Python for agents and data processing, TypeScript for user interfaces and real-time interaction. Both languages receive equal emphasis.

5. **Learning by Building**
   Every concept is practiced through building real, deployable systems—not toy examples. Projects progress from specification → implementation → testing → deployment, demonstrating the complete AI-native development lifecycle.

6. **Progressive Complexity**
   Beginners start with simple specifications and AI-assisted implementation (Parts 1-3). Professionals handle complex architectures, multi-agent systems, and production deployment (Parts 10-13). The methodology scales with the developer—the principles remain constant while the complexity increases.

7. **Transparency & Methodology**
   We don't just teach WHAT to build—we teach HOW we think, plan, specify, validate, and iterate. The book models the AI-native methodology it teaches. Every chapter shows specifications, AI prompts, generated outputs, and validation steps.

### AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native)

To ground our methodology, we explicitly distinguish three approaches to using AI in software work. These represent a progression of integration and responsibility, not mutually exclusive categories.

#### AI Assisted Development
- Role of AI: Productivity helper for individual developers (completion, suggestions, refactoring, documentation, test stubs)
- Role of Human: Full control of design and architecture; AI accelerates typing and routine tasks
- Typical Outputs: Faster code, fewer typos, small-scale automation
- Example: Using an assistant to speed up building a traditional FastAPI service or Next.js app

#### AI‑Driven Development (AIDD)
- Role of AI: Co‑creator generating significant portions of implementation from clear specifications
- Role of Human: Director/architect/validator—writes specs, reviews AI output, drives iteration and quality
- Typical Outputs: End‑to‑end scaffolds, APIs with tests, UI components, refactors guided by acceptance criteria
- Example: Provide a REST API specification; AI generates FastAPI routes, models, validation, tests, and docs

#### AI‑Native Software Development
- Role of AI: Core runtime capability; the application itself depends on intelligent agents/models
- Role of Human: System designer of agentic behaviors, context, prompts/tools, data, and deployment
- Typical Outputs: Agents with reasoning and tool use, natural language interfaces, adaptive systems
- Example: A support agent that reasons over context, coordinates tools/agents, and autonomously resolves tickets

#### Spectrum in Practice
```
AI Assisted  →  AI Driven  →  AI Native
   Helper         Co‑creator       Core System
```
- Assisted: AI helps you code faster
- Driven: AI implements from your specifications
- Native: AI is the product’s core capability

#### Why This Book Emphasizes Driven and Native
- We teach AI‑Driven practices (spec → generate → validate) as the default workflow for building software quickly and reliably
- We teach AI‑Native architectures where intelligent agents are first‑class, using OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, and TypeScript frontends
- Assisted techniques remain useful and are taught early, but the professional bar is the ability to design specifications and agent systems

### Target Audience

**Primary: Aspiring Developers**
- No prior programming experience required
- Strong emphasis on clear thinking and problem decomposition
- Comfortable learning through AI collaboration
- Goal: Build and deploy real applications quickly using AI-native workflows

**Secondary: Professional Developers**
- Have traditional programming background
- Want to leverage AI for 10x productivity
- Need to understand specification-driven development
- Goal: Transform existing skills for AI-augmented work

**Tertiary: Technical Founders and Entrepreneurs**
- Need to build MVPs and validate ideas rapidly
- Limited time for deep syntax learning
- Strong product sense but limited coding background
- Goal: Ship AI-native products to market without hiring large engineering teams

### Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy (file management, terminal basics)
- Curiosity about AI and willingness to experiment
- Logical thinking and problem-solving mindset
- **NOT required**: Programming experience, CS degree, syntax knowledge

**The Core Insight**: In the AI-native era, learning to think clearly and communicate intent precisely is more important than memorizing syntax.

---

## II. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### Principle 1: AI-First Teaching Philosophy

Every concept, example, and exercise MUST demonstrate AI-assisted development as the primary workflow, not an afterthought.

**Why This Matters:** In 2025 and beyond, professional developers collaborate WITH AI, not despite it. Teaching programming without AI collaboration is teaching an outdated workflow. Students must develop AI partnership skills from day one to be professionally relevant.

**What This Means:**
- AI tools introduced early (Part 2) and used throughout every chapter
- Every code example shows: specification → AI prompt → generated code → validation
- Students learn to write effective specifications and prompts as core skills
- AI positioned as co-reasoning partner, not autocomplete tool
- Traditional "manual coding first, AI later" approach explicitly rejected as outdated

---

### Principle 2: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology as THE Foundation

Specification-Driven Development (SDD) using Spec-Kit Plus is THE core methodology taught throughout the book, not a supplementary topic.

**Why This Matters:** In AI-native development, specifications ARE the source code. Clear specs → working software (via AI generation). Poor specs → broken software. SDD is scalable, AI-friendly, and enables professional team collaboration. This is the foundational skill that enables everything else.

**What This Means:**
- Part 5 (4 chapters) dedicated entirely to Spec-Driven Development methodology
- ALL projects use Spec-Kit Plus structure: spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md → implementation
- Students practice writing specifications WITH AI assistance (iterative refinement)
- Constitution, ADR, PHR concepts explained and practiced as real development artifacts
- Every code example includes the specification that produced it
- Specification quality is a primary success metric (not just "does code run?")

**Application:**
- Chapter 30-33 (Part 5) teach SDD formally
- ALL subsequent chapters (34-55) apply SDD to every project
- Refer to `specs/book/chapter-index.md` for specific chapter assignments

---

### Principle 3: Modern Python Standards (3.13+)

All Python code MUST use Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints throughout.

**Why This Matters:** Type hints are now standard in professional Python development. Teaching without them creates technical debt and bad habits. Modern syntax (match/case, structural patterns) improves readability. Students must learn current best practices, not legacy patterns. Type hints also improve AI code generation quality.

**What This Means:**
- Python 3.13+ syntax required; no legacy patterns or compatibility code
- Type hints mandatory for all function signatures (zero exceptions)
- Modern syntax features demonstrated and explained (walrus operator, structural pattern matching, etc.)
- No pre-3.10 type hint styles (e.g., `Optional` from typing module - use `str | None`)
- All code validated for type safety (mypy --strict or pyright)

---

### Principle 4: Test-First Mindset

Testing concepts MUST be integrated early and practiced throughout, not relegated to a single late chapter.

**Why This Matters:** Professional code is tested code. Introducing testing late makes it seem optional. Early integration normalizes testing as part of development. AI tools excel at generating tests from specifications—this is a perfect AI-native workflow (spec → AI generates code + tests → human validates).

**What This Means:**
- Unit testing introduced early in Part 4 (Python fundamentals)
- Every significant code example includes corresponding tests
- Test-writing shown as AI-assisted workflow: "Generate tests for this specification"
- TDD workflow demonstrated: write test → see it fail → generate implementation → see it pass
- Coverage expectations enforced: critical functions 100%, overall >80%
- Validation includes running tests, not just visual inspection

---

### Principle 5: Progressive Complexity with Clear Scaffolding

Content difficulty MUST increase gradually with no sudden jumps. Earlier parts have heavy support; later parts assume increasing independence.

**Why This Matters:** Beginners need scaffolding. Jumping complexity levels loses readers. Clear prerequisite chains allow modular learning and reference. Progressive complexity reduces frustration and increases completion rates. BUT: advanced readers need professional-level content, not oversimplified examples.

**What This Means:**
- **Graduated Scaffolding** (not one-size-fits-all):
  - Parts 1-3: Maximum scaffolding (complete beginners, 2 options max, simple specs)
  - Parts 4-5: Moderate scaffolding (learning Python + SDD, 3-4 options, moderate complexity)
  - Parts 6-8: Minimal scaffolding (advanced topics, multiple options, complex systems)
  - Parts 9-13: Professional level (production deployment, no artificial limits)
- Concepts introduced once, then referenced by name
- Explicit prerequisite chains documented
- No forward references without explanation ("Chapter X covers this")
- Related concepts taught together, not scattered
- Refer to `specs/book/chapter-index.md` for specific progression and `book-scaffolding` skill

---

### Principle 6: Consistent Structure Across All Chapters

All content creators (human authors and AI agents) MUST use the same shared infrastructure (skills, output styles, sub-agents) to ensure consistency.

**Why This Matters:** Consistency in form allows readers to focus on content. It makes chapters replaceable and updatable without cascading changes. Shared infrastructure enables AI and humans to collaborate effectively on content creation.

**What This Means:**
- All chapters follow identical structure (documented in `.claude/output-styles/`)
- All lessons follow identical teaching structure
- All Python code follows identical formatting standards (black, mypy --strict)
- All TypeScript code follows identical formatting standards (prettier, tsc --strict)
- All exercises follow identical structure and approach
- All content creators discover and apply skills from `.claude/skills/` contextually
- Cross-chapter consistency verified before publication

---

### Principle 7: Technical Accuracy and Currency (Always Verified)

All technical claims MUST be verified, tool versions current, and best practices demonstrated.

**Why This Matters:** Teaching outdated or incorrect practices wastes reader time and creates bad habits. Accuracy builds trust and sets professional standards. In the rapidly-evolving AI ecosystem, currency is critical.

**What This Means:**
- All Python features verified for 3.13+
- All TypeScript features verified for 5.3+ and ES2024
- All tool instructions tested (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Docker, Kubernetes)
- All external links live and current at publication
- Best practices demonstrated (PEP 8, ESLint, secure coding)
- All technical claims fact-checked and sourced
- Security practices demonstrated (no hardcoded secrets, input validation, secure defaults)
- Update triggers noted for volatile content (AI tools, package versions)

---

### Principle 8: Accessibility and Inclusivity (No Gatekeeping)

Content MUST be welcoming and accessible to diverse learners with varied backgrounds and abilities.

**Why This Matters:** Learners come from all backgrounds. Assumptions exclude people. Clarity benefits everyone. Accessibility is quality, not a feature. The AI-native era democratizes software development—our content should reflect that.

**What This Means:**
- No assumed computer science background (explain jargon on first use)
- No ableist language ("obviously", "simply", "just", "easy")
- Code examples include clear comments explaining intent
- Diverse example names/contexts; gender-neutral language
- Multiple explanation styles: text, code, diagrams, analogies
- Platform-specific instructions where setup differs (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Free/open-source alternatives always provided
- Error literacy: teach distinction between normal output and actual errors

**Error Literacy Additions:**
- Every technical lesson MUST include "Red Flags to Watch" section
- Distinguishes: ✅ Normal/Expected vs. ⚠️ Actual Problems
- Empowers learners: "Error messages are learning tools. When you see ERROR, ask your AI agent"
- Reduces anxiety about terminal output by separating signal from noise

---

### Principle 9: Show-Spec-Validate Pedagogy

Teaching MUST follow specification-first pattern: show spec FIRST, show AI generation, show code, then explain WHAT/HOW/WHY, then show validation.

**Why This Matters:** In AI-native development, code is OUTPUT not INPUT. We must teach the thinking (specification) before showing the result (code). This pattern models the actual AI-native workflow readers will use professionally.

**What This Means:**
- Present specification before code
- Show the AI prompt used to generate code
- Show the generated code
- Describe WHAT the code does (high-level overview)
- Explain HOW it works (step-by-step execution)
- Explain WHY design decisions were made
- Show validation steps (testing, security scanning)
- Show variations and related patterns
- Every chapter includes "Common Mistakes" section
- Every chapter includes "AI Exercise" (starting Ch 3)

**Example Structure:**
```
1. The Specification (what we want to build)
2. The AI Prompt (how we ask AI to build it)
3. The Generated Code (what AI produces)
4. The Explanation (what/how/why it works)
5. The Validation (testing and verification)
6. Try It Yourself (hands-on exercise)
```

---

### Principle 10: Real-World Project Integration

Projects MUST reflect realistic development scenarios with production deployment, not contrived academic exercises.

**Why This Matters:** Toy examples don't transfer to real work. Students need portfolio-worthy projects. Real-world friction (APIs, error handling, deployment, scaling) is learning opportunity, not obstacle. GitHub portfolio is essential for job seekers.

**What This Means:**
- Projects use real tools: git, Docker, Kubernetes, package managers, CI/CD
- File organization matches professional conventions (src/, tests/, .env, Dockerfile, k8s/)
- Projects published to GitHub with README, license, documentation
- Integration with real APIs and data sources (with error handling and fallback strategies)
- **Deployment is NOT optional**: all projects show production deployment path
- Projects span multiple chapters showing iterative development
- Real scalability, security, and cost considerations discussed

**Application:**
- Parts 1-5: Local development with deployment awareness
- Parts 6-9: Agent systems with testing and validation
- Parts 10-13: Full production deployment (Docker, K8s, databases, event-driven architecture)

---

### Principle 11: Tool Diversity and Honest Comparison

Multiple AI tools MUST be covered with honest comparison, not single-tool lock-in.

**Why This Matters:** AI tool landscape evolves rapidly. Teaching one tool creates fragility. Students benefit from understanding trade-offs and having backup options. Tool diversity builds adaptable problem-solving skills. Professional developers choose tools based on context, not hype.

**What This Means:**
- Part 2 (AI Tool Landscape) covers: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Zed
- Each tool's strengths and ideal use cases explained objectively
- Common workflows demonstrated across multiple tools
- Students encouraged to experiment and find personal preferences
- No vendor lock-in language; all tools presented as options with tradeoffs
- Fallback strategies when tools unavailable (rate limits, API changes, service outages)

---

### Principle 12: Cognitive Load Consciousness (Graduated)

Content MUST be deliberately structured to match audience cognitive capacity. Beginners get heavy scaffolding; professionals get realistic complexity.

**Why This Matters:** Beginners (especially non-programmers) have limited working memory. Overwhelming them loses readers. BUT advanced learners need professional-level content. Strategic simplification for beginners, realistic complexity for professionals.

**What This Means:**

**For Beginner Content (Parts 1-3):**
- Max 2 options to choose from (AI agent handles 3+ options)
- Max 5 new concepts per lesson section
- Always show minimal/simplest version first
- One new skill/concept per lesson where possible
- Remove theoretical scenarios and edge cases
- Language: "Your AI agent handles this complexity—you understand the concept"
- Trade-off: Clarity over Comprehensiveness

**For Intermediate Content (Parts 4-5):**
- 3-4 options allowed with guided selection criteria
- 7 concepts per section (more synthesis expected)
- Introduce tradeoffs explicitly
- Expect independent problem-solving with AI assistance

**For Advanced Content (Parts 6-8):**
- No artificial option limits (show ecosystem realistically)
- 10+ concepts per section (synthesis and integration expected)
- Architecture discussions (patterns, anti-patterns)
- Independent research encouraged

**For Professional Content (Parts 9-13):**
- No scaffolding (assumes competence)
- Real-world complexity (security, scale, cost, operations)
- Multiple valid approaches (architectural decisions)
- System thinking, business context, production readiness

---

### Principle 13: Concept-Before-Command Pattern

Every new tool, command, or technical concept MUST be introduced by explaining WHAT it is conceptually BEFORE showing HOW to use it. Use non-programmer examples and analogies.

**Why This Matters:** Teaching syntax without context creates cargo-cult programming (following commands without understanding). Students need mental models before execution details. Non-programmers especially need conceptual anchors before technical steps.

**What This Means:**
- Structure: WHAT (concept) → WHY (real-world value) → HOW (command) → PRACTICE (Try With AI)
- For each new term: Explain in non-programmer language on first use
- Use analogies and real-world examples before technical jargon
- Include visual diagrams when explaining complex concepts
- Avoid assumptions about prior knowledge; define terms contextually

**Example:**
> "A specification is like a blueprint for a house. Before builders start construction, architects create detailed plans showing exactly what should be built. In AI-native development, you write specifications (blueprints), and AI agents build the software (construction). The clearer your blueprint, the better the house."

---

### Principle 14: Planning-First Development (NEW)

Specification-writing is THE primary skill in AI-native development. Clear, testable specs MUST precede all implementation work.

**Why This Matters:** In traditional coding, you write code manually. In AI-native development, you write specifications and AI generates code. Therefore, specification quality directly determines output quality. Poor specs → broken code. Great specs → working software. Planning IS the work, not prep for the work.

**What This Means:**
- Every project starts with written specification (spec.md)
- Specifications include: requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, non-goals, dependencies
- AI generation happens ONLY after spec approved by human
- Iterative refinement: spec → generate → test → improve spec → regenerate (NOT manual patching)
- Specifications are versioned, reviewed, and treated as source code
- Planning is not "busywork"—it's the primary value-add of the human developer

**Application:**
- Part 5 (Spec-Driven Development) teaches specification methodology formally
- ALL chapters modeling projects must show spec-first workflow
- Code examples include the specification that produced them
- Students practice writing specs, not just reading them
- Exercises: "Write a specification for X" (not "Write code for X")

---

### Principle 15: Validation-Before-Trust (NEW)

All AI-generated outputs MUST be validated before use. Validation skills are as important as specification skills.

**Why This Matters:** AI can hallucinate, misunderstand requirements, or generate insecure code. Blind trust in AI outputs is dangerous and unprofessional. Professional developers validate everything. In AI-native workflows, validation is the critical safety mechanism.

**What This Means:**
- Read generated code before running it (understand before executing)
- Understand what code does before accepting it
- Test all generated code (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end)
- Scan for security issues (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS)
- Verify generated code matches specification
- Ask AI to explain code if unclear
- Iterate on failure: if code doesn't match spec, refine spec and regenerate (NOT manual patching)

**Application:**
- Every code example includes validation steps
- Students practice code reading and comprehension skills
- Testing taught early and reinforced throughout
- Security scanning demonstrated and required
- "Common Mistakes" sections include validation failures
- Part 6+ (Production systems): Professional validation checklists

---

### Principle 16: Bilingual Development (Python + TypeScript) (NEW)

Professional AI-native developers MUST be proficient in both Python (reasoning/backend) and TypeScript (interaction/frontend). Both languages receive equal treatment.

**Why This Matters:** Modern AI systems have two layers: Reasoning Layer (Python for agents, data, logic) and Interaction Layer (TypeScript for UIs, real-time, voice). Knowing only one language limits what you can build. Full-stack AI-native development requires bilingual fluency.

**What This Means:**
- Python standards: 3.13+, type hints mandatory, modern syntax (Part 4: 19 chapters)
- TypeScript standards: 5.3+, strict mode, ES2024 target (Part 8: 3 chapters)
- Students learn specification-writing in both languages
- Code examples demonstrate language-appropriate use cases
- Projects integrate Python backends with TypeScript frontends
- Testing covers both languages
- Deployment includes both runtimes (containerization for both)

**Application:**
- Part 4: Python mastery (Chapters 11-29)
- Part 8: TypeScript mastery (Chapters 38-40)
- Parts 9-13: Integration (realtime agents, voice, full-stack deployment)
- All full-stack projects require both languages

---

### Principle 17: Production-Ready Deployment (NEW)

All projects MUST demonstrate production deployment with cloud-native patterns, not just local development.

**Why This Matters:** "Works on my laptop" is not professional software. AI-native developers must understand containerization, orchestration, state management, and scalability. Deployment is not optional—it's the measure of whether software is actually useful.

**What This Means:**
- Docker containerization for all projects (Part 10)
- Kubernetes orchestration for multi-service systems (Part 10)
- Database integration (PostgreSQL, vector stores) (Part 11)
- Event-driven architecture patterns (Kafka, Dapr) (Part 12)
- Stateful agent deployment (Dapr actors, workflows) (Part 13)
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- Monitoring, logging, and observability (structured logging, metrics, tracing)
- Security best practices (secrets management, authentication, authorization)
- Real scalability, reliability, and cost considerations

**Application:**
- Parts 10-13 dedicated to production deployment (9 chapters)
- All projects include Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests
- Deployment examples tested and working (not theoretical)
- Real cloud deployment demonstrated
- Professional operational practices (health checks, graceful shutdown, error budgets)

---

## II.B Domain Skills Architecture (Plugin-Based)

### Philosophy: Skills as Plugins

Skills are **discovered dynamically** from the `.claude/skills/` directory. This architecture enables:
- Adding new skills without modifying constitution
- Removing obsolete skills without breaking the framework
- Contextual application based on chapter type and requirements
- Framework reusability for different book domains

**Source of Truth**: `.claude/skills/` directory structure and skill metadata

---

### Skill Categories

Skills are organized into categories based on their purpose and applicability:

#### Category 1: Pedagogical Skills (Universal)
**Purpose**: Teaching methodology, learning science, accessibility
**Required for**: All content types
**Activation**: Always active

**Examples**: 
- `learning-objectives` — Measurable outcomes aligned with Bloom's taxonomy
- `assessment-builder` — Quizzes, exercises, evaluations
- `technical-clarity` — Clear explanations, jargon management
- `book-scaffolding` — Multi-part content structure, cognitive load
- `content-evaluation-framework` — Quality rubrics

---

#### Category 2: AI-Native Development Skills
**Purpose**: Teaching specification-first, validation-first, AI collaboration
**Required for**: Technical chapters (Parts 4+)
**Activation**: When chapter involves code or specifications

**Examples**:
- `spec-example-generator` — High-quality specification patterns
- `spec-scaffolding` — Progressive specification-writing instruction
- `spec-exercise-designer` — Deliberate practice for spec-writing
- `ai-collaboration-pedagogy` — AI as co-reasoning partner
- `prompt-engineering-pedagogy` — Effective AI communication
- `validation-pedagogy` — Output validation and safety

---

#### Category 3: Content-Specific Skills
**Purpose**: Language/tool/domain-specific pedagogy
**Required for**: Specific parts or chapters
**Activation**: Based on part/chapter context

**Examples**:
- `typescript-pedagogy` — TypeScript teaching (Part 8+)
- `deployment-pedagogy` — Production deployment (Part 10+)
- `ai-tool-comparison-pedagogy` — Tool selection guidance (Part 2)

---

#### Category 4: Utilities
**Purpose**: Tooling, automation, infrastructure
**Required for**: None (quality of life)
**Activation**: On-demand

**Examples**:
- `docusaurus-deployer` — Build and deployment automation
- `quiz-generator` — Assessment generation utilities
- `skill-creator` — Meta-skill for creating new skills
- `skills-proficiency-mapper` — CEFR/Bloom's proficiency mapping

---

### Skill Discovery Protocol

Subagents discover and apply skills dynamically:

1. **Scan**: Read `.claude/skills/` directory
2. **Filter**: Select skills by category and `required_for` metadata
3. **Contextualize**: Apply additional skills based on chapter type
4. **Execute**: Invoke skills during content creation

**Example Discovery**:
```yaml
# chapter-planner subagent
base_skills:
  - category: pedagogical
  - required_for: [chapter-planner]

contextual_skills:
  - if chapter_type == "technical": add category "ai-native-development"
  - if chapter_part >= 8: add "typescript-pedagogy"
  - if chapter_part >= 10: add "deployment-pedagogy"
```

---

### Skill Metadata Standard

Every skill MUST include YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: "skill-name"
category: "pedagogical|ai-native|content-specific|utility"
description: "Clear one-line purpose"
applies_to: ["all-chapters"|"technical-chapters"|"part-X"]
required_for: ["chapter-planner"|"lesson-writer"|"technical-reviewer"]
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies: []
---
```

### Skill Quality Standards

All skills MUST:
- Include `SKILL.md` with clear purpose and activation triggers
- Provide reference documentation in `reference/` subdirectory
- Include validation scripts (where applicable) in `scripts/` subdirectory
- Specify templates (where applicable) in `templates/` subdirectory
- Declare version and dependencies in frontmatter
- Document which subagents should invoke them

---

### Governance: Flexible Validation

**Instead of**: "All content must use exactly 14 skills"

**Validation checks**:
- [ ] All **pedagogical** skills applied appropriately for chapter type
- [ ] **AI-native** skills applied for technical chapters
- [ ] **Content-specific** skills applied when part/chapter requires them
- [ ] Skill outputs meet quality standards defined in skill documentation
- [ ] No missing skills for declared requirements

**Framework principle**: Content quality depends on **appropriate skill application**, not arbitrary skill counts.

---

## IV. Non-Negotiable Rules

### What We ALWAYS Do

✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Write specifications before implementation (spec-first development)
- Validate all AI-generated code before use (read, understand, test)
- Show the specification that produced code examples
- Demonstrate both Python AND TypeScript where appropriate
- Include deployment considerations for production-relevant examples
- Test examples on multiple platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Use modern syntax (Python 3.13+, TypeScript ES2024+, strict modes)
- Provide fallback strategies when AI tools unavailable
- Frame AI as co-reasoning partner, not just coding assistant
- Teach validation skills alongside specification skills
- Plan ahead using learning sciences and pedagogical principles
- Use specialized skills and subagents to enhance content quality
- Include type hints on every function without exception
- Explain WHY, not just HOW (design decisions and reasoning)
- Provide working code examples with documented expected output
- Include "Common Mistakes" section in every chapter
- Include "AI Exercise" in every chapter (starting Ch 3)
- Validate against this Constitution before publication
- Assume readers know nothing (no gatekeeping)
- Show: specification → AI prompt → generated code → validation
- Encourage iterative refinement with AI tools

### What We NEVER Do

❌ **NEVER:**
- Generate code without a specification
- Trust AI outputs without validation
- Skip testing for "simple" examples
- Assume Python-only is sufficient (bilingual development required)
- Teach local-only development without deployment path
- Present AI as infallible or magical
- Skip security scanning of generated code
- Use deprecated syntax or outdated patterns
- Hardcode configuration (use environment variables)
- Deploy without observability (logging, monitoring, health checks)
- Use vague gatekeeping terms ("easy", "simple", "obvious")
- Include untested or broken code
- Assume reader knowledge or background
- Skip type hints for "simple" functions
- Condescend to readers
- Hardcode secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords
- Make technical claims without verification
- Publish without human review
- Leave placeholder text or TODOs in published chapters
- Contradict earlier chapters without explicit explanation
- Present single AI tool as mandatory

### When to Escalate for Human Decision

**Always flag for human judgment when:**
- Breaking changes in Python/TypeScript/tool versions
- Significant methodology shifts affecting prior chapters
- Content contradicts earlier chapters
- Uncertain or debatable technical claims
- Accessibility concerns
- Copyright or attribution issues
- Major style/voice inconsistencies
- Security vulnerabilities or risks
- Deployment architecture decisions
- Production readiness concerns

## V. Development Workflow

### The Spec-Driven Development Loop (What We Teach)

All content development MUST model the SDD loop we're teaching readers:

```
Problem/Idea
    ↓
Human + AI → Write Specification (spec.md)
    ↓ (iterate until spec is clear and testable)
Approved Specification
    ↓
AI Agent → Generate Implementation
    ↓
Human → Validate Output (read, test, verify)
    ↓
    Pass? → Deploy
    Fail? → Refine Spec → Regenerate
```

**Key Principle**: We teach readers to think in specifications, collaborate with AI on implementation, and validate rigorously. Our own workflow MUST model this.

### Our Meta-Application: Creating Book Content

When creating book chapters, we apply the same loop:

**Phase 1: SPECIFY** (Human + Main Claude)
- **Input**: Source material, chapter topic, learning goals, target audience tier
- **Process**: Collaborative specification writing
- **Output**: `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-spec.md`
- **Acceptance**: Spec is clear, testable, approved by human

**Phase 2: PLAN** (chapter-planner subagent)
- **Input**: Approved specification
- **Process**: Break spec into lesson plans and task checklist
- **Output**: `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-plan.md`, `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-tasks.md`
- **Acceptance**: Plan is detailed, tasks are actionable, complexity tier appropriate

**Phase 3: IMPLEMENT** (lesson-writer subagent)
- **Input**: Plan and tasks
- **Process**: Write lesson content using 14 domain skills, appropriate output styles
- **Output**: `docs/part-X/chapter-Y/index.md` + lesson files
- **Acceptance**: Content follows plan, uses correct complexity tier, models spec-first workflow

**Phase 4: VALIDATE** (technical-reviewer + spec-reviewer + prompt-validator)
- **Input**: Complete chapter content
- **Process**: Validate against spec, constitution, quality standards
- **Output**: Validation report with pass/fail + issues categorized (critical/major/minor)
- **Acceptance**: All critical issues resolved, chapter meets quality gates

**Phase 5: DEPLOY** (Human final review → merge to main → Docusaurus build)
- **Input**: Validated chapter
- **Process**: Human editorial polish → publish
- **Output**: Live chapter on website (https://ai-native.panaversity.org)
- **Acceptance**: Builds cleanly, no broken links, renders correctly

### Quality Gates

Each phase includes:
- **Entry criteria**: What must exist before starting
- **Exit criteria**: What must be true before advancing
- **Validation**: How to verify quality
- **Iteration**: When to return to previous phase vs advance

**Critical Principle**: If validation fails, we improve the SPECIFICATION and regenerate, rather than manually patching the output. This models the spec-driven workflow we teach.

## VI. Infrastructure

### Domain Skills (Plugin-Based Discovery)

All content creators MUST apply skills contextually from `.claude/skills/` directory as defined in Section II.B.

**Skill Discovery**: Subagents scan `.claude/skills/` directory and apply skills based on:
- Category (pedagogical, ai-native, content-specific, utility)
- Chapter type (conceptual, technical, hybrid)
- Part requirements (TypeScript for Part 8+, deployment for Part 10+)
- Subagent needs (declared in subagent metadata)

**No Hardcoded Lists**: Skills are plugins. Adding/removing skills does not require constitution changes.

**Note**: Skills directory requires update to align with v3.0.0 (separate feature).

### Output Styles (Format Specifications)

All content MUST conform to output styles located in `.claude/output-styles/`:

1. **chapters.md** — Chapter structure and Docusaurus frontmatter format
2. **lesson.md** — Individual lesson section formatting and teaching structure

These are **generic, reusable templates** applicable to any educational content project.

### Sub-Agents (Orchestrators)

Three specialized agents manage the SDD loop phases (located in `.claude/agents/`):

1. **chapter-planner** — Takes approved spec → creates detailed lesson plans and task checklists
2. **lesson-writer** — Takes lesson plan → writes complete lesson content with contextually appropriate skills applied
3. **technical-reviewer** — Takes completed chapter → validates technical accuracy, pedagogical effectiveness, and constitutional alignment

**Note**: Subagents discover available skills dynamically from `.claude/skills/` directory.

## VII. Governance

### This Constitution's Authority

- **Source of Truth:** Supreme governing document for all book project decisions
- **Precedence:** All specifications, skills, output styles, and sub-agents must align with this Constitution
- **Enforcement:** All chapters validated against this Constitution before publication

### Amendment Process

**For Small Changes** (clarifications, wording):
- Make changes directly with commit message referencing this Constitution
- Increment PATCH version only

**For Significant Changes** (new principles, removed requirements, major redefinitions):
- Document rationale in commit message or linked ADR
- Update VERSION field
- Increment MAJOR or MINOR per semantic versioning
- Review all dependent templates and chapters for alignment
- Update "Last Amended" date
- Create migration guide for breaking changes

**For Proposals:**
1. Document the current problem or gap
2. Propose specific change to Constitution text
3. Justify with rationale (pedagogical, technical, practical)
4. Identify affected chapters and templates
5. Seek review and approval before implementing

### Compliance Verification

- **AI Agents** verify Constitutional alignment in outputs before handoff
- **Human Reviewer** confirms adherence before publication
- **Automated Checks** enforce standards where possible (mypy --strict, black, prettier, tsc --strict, Docusaurus build)
