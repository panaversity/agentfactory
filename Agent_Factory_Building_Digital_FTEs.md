## Part 3: The Three Waves of AI
<!-- Page 13 -->

| Wave | Predictive AI | Generative AI | Agentic AI |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Focus** | Analyzing data to predict outcomes | Creating content from data | Autonomous actions and iterative learning |
| **Capability** | Analyze past data to predict future outcomes | Creating content (text, images, code, videos) | Autonomous actions, environment interaction, iterative learning |
| **Why It Matters** | Enabled data-driven decision-making | Empowered creativity and productivity | AI becomes proactive, managing complex tasks |

### What is an AI Agent?
<!-- Page 14 -->

An AI agent is a piece of software that can pursue a goal by observing its environment, deciding what to do next, taking actions (often by calling tools/APIs or controlling a robot), and learning from the results—then repeating the loop until the goal is met.

**What makes it an "agent" (not just a chatbot)?**

- **Goal-driven:** You give it an objective ("pull the Xero trial balance daily and export CSV"), not just a single prompt
- **Tool use / actions:** It can call functions, APIs, databases, browsers, or devices—not only generate text
- **State & memory:** It keeps context (short-term working state and longer-term memory) across steps
- **Autonomy:** It plans multi-step work, executes, checks results, and adjusts without you micromanaging

### The Next Leap in AI
<!-- Page 15 -->

Moving from understanding to action:

| 🧠 Large Language Models | → | ⚡ Large Action Models |
|--------------------------|---|------------------------|
| AI that responds | | AI that acts, orchestrates, and remembers |

### Autonomous Agents: The Five Powers
<!-- Page 16 -->

Systems that can see, hear, reason, act, and remember:

| Power | Icon | Capability |
|-------|------|------------|
| **See** | 👁 | Visual understanding |
| **Hear** | 👂 | Audio processing |
| **Reason** | 🧠 | Complex decision-making |
| **Act** | ⚡ | Execute and orchestrate |
| **Remember** | 💾 | Maintain context and learn |

### Redefining Everything
<!-- Page 17 -->

How agentic AI transforms our world:

| Area | Transformation |
|------|----------------|
| 💼 **How We Work** | AI agents as collaborative teammates |
| 💳 **How We Transact** | Autonomous systems managing complex transactions |
| 🏗 **How We Build** | AI-first development from high-level intent |

### 2025: Year of Agents

## Part 4: The Core Strategic Decision
<!-- Pages 19-22 -->

### Two Paths to AI Agentic Automation

| Aspect | Option A: "Smart Consultant" (General Agents) | Option B: "Assembly Line" (Custom Agents) |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Example** | Claude Code, Goose | OpenAI Agents SDK |
| **Focus** | High-level reasoning, autonomy, and flexibility | Reliability, process control, and specific workflows |
| **Analogy** | Hiring a senior employee who figures out how to solve the problem | Building a factory machine that performs a specific task perfectly every time |

### Decision Matrix: How to Choose?

| Requirement | Choose General Agent (Claude Code, Goose) | Choose Custom Agent (OpenAI SDK, Claude Agent SDK) |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Type** | Novel, Problem-Solving | Repetitive, Standardized |
| **End User** | Developers / Technical Staff | Non-Technical / Customers |
| **Error Tolerance** | High (Human in the loop) | Low (Must be reliable) |
| **Cost Sensitivity** | Low (High value per task) | High (Volume optimization needed) |
| **Implementation** | Instant (Install & Run) | Weeks (Design & Build) |

## Part 5: General vs Custom Agents
<!-- Pages 20-27 -->

### General Purpose Agents (Claude Code, Goose)
**The Power of Generalization**

**What it is:** An autonomous agent living in your terminal/environment

**Key Features:**
- **Zero-Shot Planning:** You state the goal; it determines the steps
- **Deep Integration:** Accesses local files, git history, and command line directly
- **Enhanced by MCP:** Uses "Model Context Protocol" to plug in external systems (e.g., database access) instantly
- **Enhanced by Agent Skill:** Modular capabilities (organized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources)

**Best For:**
- Complex debugging & coding
- Ad-hoc analysis (e.g., "Why are sales down in Q3?")
- Tasks requiring human-like judgment

> It is optimized for the 'loop' of thinking. It reads, thinks, acts, and corrects itself. It is expensive per task but invaluable for non-routine work.

### Custom Agents (OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK)
**The Power of Specialization**

**What it is:** A framework for building AI workflows

**Key Features:**
- **Guardrails:** Strict control over what the agent can and cannot do
- **Orchestration:** Define exact hand-offs between multiple agents (e.g., Triage Agent → Support Agent)
- **UI/UX Flexibility:** Can be embedded in web apps, Slack, or internal dashboards
- **Enhanced by MCP and Agent Skills:** To plug in external systems and modular capabilities

**Best For:**
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- High-volume tasks (e.g., processing 5,000 invoices)
- Customer-facing interactions (requires strict safety)

> "Here, you are the architect. The AI is just a component. You don't want a customer service bot 'getting creative' with your return policy—you want it to follow the script."

### The "Trojan Horse" of AI
<!-- Page 23 -->

**Why "Claude Code" is Actually a General Agent**

*Moving Beyond the Name: Code as a Mechanism, Not a Constraint*

- **The Misconception:** The name implies it is a tool strictly for software engineers—just a syntax highlighter or autocomplete
- **The Reality:** It is an Autonomous Problem Solver that happens to speak the language of code
- **The Distinction:**
  - **Coding Agents (e.g., Cursor):** Role-bound to software development workflows
  - **General Agents (Claude Code):** Solve problems across any domain using code as the universal interface

> "Don't let the name fool you. Calling it a 'Coding Agent' is like calling a CEO an 'Email Writer' just because they use email to do their job. Code is simply the tool it uses to exert power over the computer."

### Authority Defines the Scope of Action
<!-- Page 24 -->

| Feature | Coding Agent (e.g., Cursor) | General Agent (Claude Code) |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Scope** | Software development | Any business domain |
| **Identity** | Developer's pair programmer | Digital employee |
| **Habitat** | Embedded in developer tooling | Operates across system-level tools |
| **Built For** | Developers | Anyone solving problems |
| **Example Tasks** | "Check network status", "Refactor this module", "Write tests" | "Plan your 2026", "Draft emails", "Why did sales drop?" |

### The Cognitive Leap
<!-- Page 25 -->

**From "Prediction" to "Reasoning"**

**Traditional Coding Agents (Predictive):**
- Logic: "Based on the last 10 lines, what is the most likely next line?"
- Limit: They cannot fix their own mistakes without human intervention

**General Agents (Reasoning Loop):**
- Logic: Uses an **OODA Loop** (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)
- The Workflow:
  1. **Observe:** "I see an error in the logs."
  2. **Decide:** "I will check if the Docker container is running."
  3. **Act:** Executes Docker command.
  4. **Correct:** "That didn't work, let me try a different flag."

> "Coding agents predict text. General agents reason through problems. They enter a loop of thinking—acting, checking the result, and self-correcting. This is what allows them to handle complex tasks without you holding their hand."

### Code is the Universal Interface
<!-- Page 26 -->

**Why Business Questions Get Code Answers**

**The Paradigm Shift:** We don't just write code to build software; we use code to interrogate reality.

**Example: "Why did sales drop in Q3?"**
- A Coding Agent: Would confuse this for a code comment
- A General Agent:
  1. Writes a SQL query to fetch sales data
  2. Writes a Python script to visualize the trend
  3. Analyzes the chart
  4. Answer: "Sales dropped because of 40% churn in the Enterprise sector."

> "This is the core of our strategy. The General Agent acts as a Business Analyst. It translates a human question into a code execution to get a factual answer."

### Infinite Extensibility via MCP and Agent Skills
<!-- Page 27 -->

**Breaking the "Coder" Stereotype**

**The Enabler:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent Skills

**How it expands the role:**
- Plug in Slack MCP and Skill → Becomes a **Communications Manager**
- Plug in Salesforce MCP and Skill → Becomes a **RevOps Specialist**
- Plug in Xero/QuickBooks MCP and Skill → Becomes a **Financial Auditor**

**The Verdict:** A strictly defined "Coding Agent" cannot send messages or audit finances. A General Agent can, provided you give it the right "hands" (MCP) and "procedures" (Agent Skill).

> "This is why we classify it as 'General.' If you plug in a Finance MCP and Skill, it's a Finance Agent. If you plug in a Sales MCP and Skill, it's a Sales Agent. Code is just the glue that holds it all together."

---

## Part 6: Agent Skills & MCP
<!-- Pages 28, 34-43 -->

### Skills and MCP Combination
<!-- Page 28 -->

**Skills are "Expertise Packs" (instructions + logic) while MCP is the "Data Pipe" (connectivity)**

| Agent Skills | MCP |
|--------------|-----|
| **The "How-To"** | **The "With-What"** |
| These are modular folders (with a SKILL.md) that teach Claude a specific, repeatable workflow (e.g., "Analyze this financial statement according to our company's Q4 risk framework"). It's about standardizing expertise. | This is the protocol that connects those skills to your live data (e.g., your SQL database or Jira) |

### How We Used to Think About Agents
<!-- Page 34 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Four separate cards showing siloed agent types - "Coding Agent" with code icon, "Research Agent" with globe icon, "Finance Agent" with chart icon, "Marketing Agent" with presentation board icon. Each has the Claude/AI logo with bidirectional arrows to its domain-specific icon, showing isolated loops.]*

This illustrates the OLD way of thinking—separate, siloed agents for each domain.

### Code is the Universal Interface
<!-- Page 35 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Left panel shows "Coding Agent" with Claude logo and code icon in a loop. Right panel shows "Use cases" with multiple icons: globe (research), documents, presentation board (marketing), financial chart, chat bubble (communications), and calendar/spreadsheet. An arrow connects the coding agent to all these use cases.]*

The NEW paradigm: A single coding agent can handle ALL use cases through code as the universal interface.

### General Agent Architecture
<!-- Page 36 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Complex architecture diagram on dark blue background with glowing neural pathways. Left side shows "General Agent" as a glowing brain with </> code symbol, surrounded by code snippets. Center shows "UNIVERSAL INTERFACE (CODE)" as a hub. Two labeled pathways connect them: "Python (OpenAI/Claude SDK)" and "SKILL.md (Instructions)". Right side shows business domain outputs connected via glowing pipelines: DATA ANALYTICS, DOCUMENT PROCESSING, CRM, FINANCE, HR, SUPPLY CHAIN—each with relevant icons.]*

This shows how the General Agent connects through code to ALL business functions.

### What are Agent Skills?
<!-- Page 37 - Visual Description -->

**Definition:** Skills are **organized collections of files** that package **composable procedural knowledge** for agents.

**Example Folder Structure:**
```
anthropic_brand/
├── SKILL.md
├── docs.md
├── slide-decks.md
└── apply_template.py
```

### Skills are Just Folders
<!-- Page 39 -->

The same folder structure applies—Skills are simply organized directories containing files like SKILL.md, docs.md, slide-decks.md, and apply_template.py.

### Skills Can Include Scripts as Tools
<!-- Page 40 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Two code panels connected by an arrow. Left panel (tan/orange) shows markdown file "anthropic/brand_styling/slide-decks.md" with styling specifications. Right panel (purple/blue) shows Python script "anthropic/brand_styling/apply_template.py" with code to process presentations.]*

**Example Markdown (slide-decks.md):**
```markdown
## Anthropic Slide Decks

- Intro/outro slides
  - background color: `#141413`
  - foreground color: oat
- Section slides:
  - background color: `#da7857`
  - foreground color: `#141413`

Use the `./apply_template.py` script to update a pptx file in-place.
```

**Example Python Script (apply_template.py):**
```python
import sys
from pptx import Presentation

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("USAGE: apply_template.py <pptx>")
    sys.exit(1)

prs = Presentation(sys.argv[1])
for slide in prs.slides:
    ...
```

### Skills are Progressively Disclosed
<!-- Page 41 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Three file panels showing progressive disclosure. Large blue panel shows SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and overview. Two smaller orange panels show linked files slide-decks.md and docs.md with more detailed specifications.]*

**SKILL.md Structure:**
```yaml

```
```markdown
## Overview

This skill provides Anthropic's official brand identity resources for PowerPoint
presentations. It includes a pre-branded template and tools to apply Anthropic
styling to existing presentations.

## Colors

- Dark: `#141413` - Primary text and dark backgrounds
- Light: `#faf9f5` - Light backgrounds and text on dark
- Light Gray: `#e8e6dc` - Subtle backgrounds

## Workflows

When creating presentations, read `./slide-decks.md`
When creating professional documents, read `./docs.md`
```

### Manual Prompting vs. Agent Skills
<!-- Page 42 -->

| Feature | Manual Prompting | Agent Skills (SKILL.md) |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Reliability** | Ad-hoc / Best effort | Deterministic / Script-backed |
| **Token Cost** | Pay for "rules" in every turn | Load rules only when triggered |
| **Asset Type** | Disposable conversation | Reusable, scalable IP |
| **Integration** | Requires a human "paster" | API-ready via Agent SDKs |

### Trends in the Skills Ecosystem
<!-- Page 43 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Three checkbox items on a tan background]*

✅ More complex, production-grade skills  
✅ Skills complementing MCP servers  
✅ Non-developers building high-value skills

---

## Part 7: The Agent Factory Concept
<!-- Pages 29-33 -->

### Agent Factory

> "Welcome. We are entering the era of the 'Agent Factory.' While the industry talks about General Agents and Custom SDKs as separate trends, we are going to look at how they converge. As you'll see that Code is the Universal Interface that allows a General Agent to transform your knowledge into a deployed Custom Skill or Custom Agent."

### Enterprise Architecture Shift
<!-- Page 30 -->

**From SaaS Tools to Digital FTEs**

| Before: Tool-Centric Enterprise | After: Agent-Centric Enterprise |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Humans operate SaaS tools | Humans manage outcomes |
| Logic lives in people's heads | Logic lives in Specs & Skills |
| Automation is brittle and task-level | Automation is goal-driven |
| Knowledge is undocumented and unscalable | Knowledge is reusable IP |
| Humans → SaaS Apps → APIs → Data | Humans → Digital FTEs (Agents) → Agent Skills (SKILL.md) + MCP → Enterprise Systems & Data |

**Key Shift:** From tools you use → digital teammates you manage

### The Workflow
<!-- Page 31 -->

**Concept: How the "Factory" works**

1. **The Spec:** You provide a Markdown file describing the goal (e.g., "Automate Q3 Financial Audits")
2. **The Builder (Claude Code):** Analyzes the spec, scans documentation (SDKs/APIs), and identifies the necessary tools
3. **The Manufacturing:** Claude Code generates Custom Agent or the Custom SKILL.md and the supporting code
4. **The Result:** A production-ready Custom Agent or Custom Skill is born in minutes

### The Engine of Automated Automation
<!-- Page 32 -->

General Agents (Claude Code) are the "Engine" that uses Spec-Driven Development to manufacture "Custom Skills" and "Custom Agents."

                     └─────────────────────┘

         Code: The Universal Interface
```

### The Technical Engine
<!-- Page 33 -->

**Concept: Why a General Agent can build a Custom Agent**

- **The Logic:** AI agents have transitioned from "Text Generators" to "Action Engines"
- **The Loop:** Claude Code operates in a **Read-Think-Code-Execute** loop
- **The Outcome:** Because Code is the universal interface, the General Agent can "write" the instructions (SKILL.md) or the Python code (OpenAI/Claude SDK) required for any business use case—from data analytics to document processing

**SKILL.md Format Specification:**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description for agent discovery
---

# Skill Title                              (~100 tokens)

## When to Use
Trigger conditions and use cases.

## Instructions
Step-by-step guidance for the agent.

## Examples
Concrete examples of correct behavior.        → Progressive
                                              → Disclosure
## References
See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for detailed docs.
See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md) for more examples.
```

**Folder Structure with Token Usage:**
```
.claude/skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md      # Entry point (~100 tokens at startup)
├── REFERENCE.md  # Loaded on-demand (0 tokens until needed)
├── EXAMPLES.md   # Loaded on-demand (0 tokens until needed)
├── scripts/
└── helper.py     # EXECUTED, never loaded (0 tokens always)
                  ↳ 0 tokens (executed only)
```

### SkillPort: Universal Skills for Any Agent
<!-- Page 49 - Visual Description -->

**One MCP Server → Skills Everywhere**

*[VISUAL: Architecture diagram showing Skills Directory at top, feeding into SkillPort MCP hub with search_skills(), load_skill(), read_skill_file() functions, which connects to multiple agent frameworks: OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Custom Agent]*

**How It Works:**

1. **Install SkillPort:**
```bash
pip install skillport
```

2. **Add to your MCP config:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillport": {...}
  }
}
```

✓ Your agent now has Skills - Same SKILL.md format as Claude Code

**What You Get:**
- ✅ Same skills work across ALL agents
- ✅ No code changes to your agent
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (token efficient)
- ✅ Works with any MCP-compatible framework

> 💡 Native support (Claude Code, Cursor, Goose) = No bridge needed. Everything else = SkillPort is the answer.

**Official spec:** agentskills.io/integrate-skills

### MCP + Skills: Token-Efficient Agent Architecture
<!-- Page 50 - Visual Description -->

**The Token Problem:**

| Approach | Token Usage |
|----------|-------------|
| **MCP Tools Only** | 14,000 - 80,000+ tokens (Every tool definition loaded) |
| **Skills Only** | ~100 tokens per skill (Instructions loaded on-demand) |
| **Skills + Scripts** | ~100 tokens (Scripts EXECUTED - 0 tokens) |

⚠️ **Warning:** 5 MCP servers = 50,000+ tokens BEFORE conversation starts

**The Solution Pattern:**
```
SKILL.md (~100 tokens)
"When user needs X, run scripts/tool.py"
         │
         ▼
scripts/tool.py (0 tokens - EXECUTED)
Calls MCP server OR executes locally.
Returns only: final result
         │
         ▼
Agent Context Window
Only result enters context (minimal)
```

**Result:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Context consumption | MCP tools consuming 41% | Skills + Scripts consuming 3% |

> "80-98% token reduction while maintaining full capability" — Jared Palmer, Vercel

**When to Use Each:**

| Use MCP Directly | Use Skills + Scripts |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Simple, single API call | Complex multi-step workflows |
| Infrequent tool use | Repeated operations |
| Quick lookups | Data processing, validation |

## Part 9: AI Development Revolution
<!-- Pages 54-56 -->

### The AI Revolution in Software
<!-- Page 54 -->

**Three parallel paths transforming how we build and deploy technology:**

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Use Coding Agent to Program (Claude Code)** | Supercharge Coding |
| **Develop AI Agents (OpenAI Agents SDK)** | Create Products with AI at the core |
| **AIOps (Using AI Agents for AI Operations)** | Maintain, Monitor, & Scale AI Systems |

### The AI Development Revolution
<!-- Page 55 -->

**The most significant transformation in software development**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The scale of transformation** | The $3 trillion developer economy (equivalent to France's GDP) and why it's being restructured in 2-3 years instead of the typical 10-15 year cycle |
| **Developer evolving role** | The shift from developer-as-typist to developer-as-orchestrator |
| **Why this is different?** | Internal disruption (software disrupting itself), universal impact (all roles affected), unprecedented speed, and the recursion effect |
| **The autonomous agent era** | The Evolution from code completion → function generation → feature implementation → autonomous agents (Gen 1 through Gen 4) |

### Essential Tools Ecosystem

## Part 10: Spec-Driven Development
<!-- Pages 57-62 -->

### Spec-Driven Development
<!-- Page 58 -->

**Clear specifications unlock AI agent potential**

**The Problem with "Vibe Coding":**
Unclear requirements lead to endless iterations and unpredictable outputs from AI agents

**The Solution:**
Write detailed specs before coding. AI agents execute better with clear instructions.

**Spec First → AI Executes → Quality Results**

**Benefits:**
- Consistent AI outputs
- Fewer iterations needed
- Better team alignment

### Spec Kit Plus
<!-- Page 59 -->

**Templates and standards for writing clear, actionable specifications that AI agents can execute**

**What It Provides:**
- Feature specifications
- Vertical Sub agents and Skills
- Prompt History and Architecture decision records
- Test Driven Development

**Example SPEC.md:**
```markdown
Feature: User Auth
Requirements:
• OAuth 2.0
• JWT tokens
• Session mgmt

Acceptance:
• Login < 2sec
• 99.9% uptime

→ AI Agent → Production Code
```

> **Transform ideas into AI-executable specs**

**Resource:** https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus

### SDD Workflow
<!-- Page 60 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Flow diagram showing the Spec Driven Development workflow with purple command boxes connected by arrows:]*

```
/constitution → /specify → /plan → /tasks → /implement
                              ↓           ↓
                          /clarify    /analyze
```

### The Nine Pillars
<!-- Page 61 -->

1. **AI CLI & Coding Agents** (tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI GPT5-Codex)
2. **Markdown as Programming Language** (natural language specifications become executable)
3. **MCP Standard** (Model Context Protocol—universal tool integration)
4. **AI-First IDEs** (editors like Zed and Cursor built for AI collaboration)
5. **Linux Universal Dev Environment** (standardized development through WSL/Mac/Linux)
6. **Test-Driven Development** (TDD for quality confidence at scale)
7. **Specification-Driven Development with SpecKit Plus** (structured methodology)
8. **Composable Vertical Skills** (reusable domain expertise components)
9. **Universal Cloud-Native Deployment** (standardized infrastructure with Kubernetes, Docker, Dapr)

### Agent Evals (The "Exam" for Your Digital Employee)
<!-- Page 62 -->

**Goal:** To differentiate "Testing Code" (TDD) from "Testing Reasoning." Enterprises need to know the accuracy rate of an agent before paying for it.

**The "Golden Dataset":** Before deployment, the agent must pass a set of 50 real-world scenarios (e.g., "Here is a messy invoice, extract the tax ID")

**Accuracy Scoring:** Move beyond "Pass/Fail" code tests. Introduce "Semantic Similarity" scoring—did the agent understand the intent even if the phrasing was different?

**Regression Testing:** "Every time we update the SKILL.md, we run the 'Exam' to ensure previous skills haven't degraded."

## Part 11: Monetizing Expertise
<!-- Pages 63-64 -->

### Monetizing Expertise: The 2026 Revenue Playbook
<!-- Page 63 -->

**Beyond the Service: 4 Models for Monetizing Agent Skills and Custom Agents**
*Aligning Price with the Economic Value of Codified Intelligence*

| Model | How | Value |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Model 1: "Digital FTE" (Subscription)** | Monthly fee for a fully managed, hosted agent (e.g., $1k/mo) | "Hands-off" automation for the client |
| **Model 2: "Success Fee" (Outcome-Based)** | Commission on results (e.g., $5 per lead, 2% of savings) | High-trust "Pay-per-Value" alignment |
| **Model 3: "License" (IP Ownership)** | Annual or Perpetual fee to use your proprietary Agent Skills and logic folders within their infrastructure | Client keeps data in-house; you monetize the "Recipe" (The SKILL.md). (Defense, FinTech, Healthcare) |
| **Model 4: "Skill Marketplace" (Distribution)** | Sell modular "Expertise Packs" via a store or ecosystem | Scale through volume; build a brand around specific niche expertise |

### Deep Dive into the License Model
<!-- Page 64 -->

**In the world of Spec-Driven Development, the "License" isn't just for software—it's for the Skill Folder and Agents**

| License Type | What is being sold? | Revenue Style |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **White-Label** | The right to rebrand your Agent Skill, MCP or Agents as their own | High Upfront + Royalty |
| **Enterprise Site License** | Unlimited use of a Skill, MCP, and Agents across a whole organization | Annual Recurring (ARR) |
| **Developer License** | The right to use your Skill and MCP as a "sub-module" in their agents or SubAgent | Usage-based or Flat Tier |

## Part 12: Digital FTE Economics
<!-- Pages 65-73 -->

### Our Vision
<!-- Page 65 -->

### What Defines a Digital FTE?
<!-- Page 66 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Four panel infographic with icons showing the four characteristics of a Digital FTE]*

**A Digital FTE is an AI worker engineered for predictability and purpose. It has four defining characteristics:**

| Characteristic | Icon | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| **Defined Role** | Org chart | It is assigned a specific job function, similar to a human employee |
| **Uses Tools & APIs** | Gears | It interacts with other systems and data sources to complete tasks |
| **Operates Continuously** | Circular arrows | It is designed for persistent, ongoing work, not just on-demand queries |
| **Predictable Cost & Behaviour** | Balance scale | Its operational parameters are controlled and measurable |

### Digital FTE Explained
<!-- Pages 67-68 -->

**Digital FTE stands for Digital Full-Time Equivalent**

*To understand why this is a "Monetization Playbook" item, it's best to look at it as the transition from selling software to selling labor.*

**1. The Origin: What is an "FTE"?**
In traditional business, an FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is a unit of measurement used to represent the workload of one full-time employee (typically 40 hours a week).
- If you have two part-time employees working 20 hours each, they equal 1.0 FTE
- Companies use this metric to decide their "headcount" budget

**2. The Shift: What is a "Digital FTE"?**
A Digital FTE is an AI agent that is built, "hired," and priced as if it were a human employee. Instead of charging for "software licenses" or "API tokens," you are charging for a virtual role.
- **Traditional SaaS:** You pay $50/month per user for a tool (like Salesforce)
- **Digital FTE:** You pay $1,500/month for an "AI Sales Agent" that performs the work of a junior staffer

**3. Why this is a Monetization Power-Move**
"Digital FTE" is a key model because it changes who pays for the AI:
- **Tapping into "Headcount" Budgets:** IT budgets (software) are usually small and strict. HR/Departmental budgets (salaries) are often 10x larger. By calling your agent a "Digital FTE," you can charge significantly more because you are being compared to a $50,000 salary, not a $50 software subscription
- **Outcome over Usage:** Customers don't care how many "tokens" the agent uses; they care that the job is done. A Digital FTE price is easy for a CEO to understand: "I'm paying $1k for a bot that does $4k worth of human work."

**4. How it fits your "Agent Skills" Story**
1. **Your Knowledge:** You know how to do "Invoice Reconciliation"
2. **Claude Code:** You use it to turn that knowledge into an Agent Skill (SKILL.md)
3. **The Digital FTE:** You wrap that skill in a bot and sell it as a "Digital Accountant" (1.0 Digital FTE)

### Architecture-First Foundation
<!-- Page 69 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Blueprint-style illustration showing five transparent blue boxes labeled "Digital FTE" sitting on a solid gray concrete foundation labeled "CORE ARCHITECTURE"]*

**"Our strategy is built on a deliberate, architecture-first foundation."**

**Key Concept:** We are pursuing an Architecture-First AI Workforce Strategy.

**Explanation:** Before building individual agents, we designed a robust and scalable framework. This ensures that every Digital FTE is built on a common, cost-effective, and interoperable platform, preventing the creation of disconnected, expensive AI silos.

### Technology Stack
<!-- Page 70 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Four-quadrant diagram with icons showing the four pillars]*

**"The technology stack is engineered for intelligence and interoperability."**

**Four core pillars support our Digital FTE ecosystem:**

| Pillar | Technology |
|--------|------------|
| **Agent Intelligence** | Claude Code with Agent Skills |
| **Interoperability** | MCP (Model Context Protocol) |
| **Backends** | FastAPI + Databases |
| **Infrastructure** | Cloud-native |

### The ROI of Autonomy: Human FTE vs. Digital FTE
<!-- Page 71 -->

**Digital FTE is "The 24/7 Employee."** Unlike a human 1.0 FTE who works 40 hours, a Digital FTE works 168 hours a week (24/7) with zero fatigue.

| Feature | Human FTE (Average) | Digital FTE (AI Agent) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Availability** | 40 hours / week | 168 hours / week (24/7) |
| **Monthly Cost** | $4,000 – $8,000+ | $500 – $2,000 |
| **Ramp-up Time** | 3 – 6 Months | Instant (via SKILL.md) |
| **Consistency** | Variable (85–95% accuracy) | Predictable (99%+ consistency) |
| **Scaling** | Linear (Hire 10 people for 10x work) | Exponential (Instant duplication) |
| **Cost per Task** | ~$3.00 – $6.00 | ~$0.25 – $0.50 |

### The 'Aha!' Moment for Your Clients
<!-- Page 72 -->

- A Human FTE works about **2,000 hours a year**; a Digital FTE works nearly **9,000**
- When you sell a 'Digital Accountant' based on your proprietary knowledge, you aren't just giving them a tool that is 10x cheaper
- You are giving them an employee that **never sleeps, never forgets a compliance rule, and can be 'cloned' instantly** when the business grows

### Pro-Tip for Your Sales Presentation
<!-- Page 73 -->

> **Point out that the "Cost per Task" reduction (from ~$5.00 to ~$0.50) is an 85–90% cost saving. This is usually the threshold where a CEO will approve a project without further debate.**

### The "Skill-First" Monetization Pipeline
<!-- Page 74 -->

**Strategy Summary: Turning Knowledge into Gold**

1. **Phase 1: Knowledge Extraction**
   - Use Claude Code + your business "Spec" to build a specialized Skill folder

2. **Phase 2: Asset Hardening**
   - Finalize the SKILL.md and verify the deterministic logic (Python/Bash)

3. **Phase 3: Deployment & Capture**
   - Deploy via the Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Agents SDK and choose your monetization pillar (FTE, Success, License, or Marketplace)

### The AI Agent Factory: Your Playbook for Monetizing Expertise
<!-- Page 75 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Comprehensive infographic divided into two sections with colorful illustrations]*

**The New AI Toolkit: Choosing Your Agent**

| Agent Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **General Agents: The "Smart Consultant"** | Highly flexible AI that autonomously figures out complex, non-routine problems |
| **Custom Agents: The "Assembly Line"** | Purpose-built AI for reliable, specific workflows like customer support or data processing |

**Quick Decision Guide:**

| Choose General Agent If... | Choose Custom Agent If... |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Task Type: Task is novel or requires problem-solving | Task Type: Task is repetitive and standardised |
| End User: User is technical (e.g., developers) | End User: User is non-technical (e.g., customers) |
| Error Tolerance: High (a human is in the loop) | Error Tolerance: Low (must be highly reliable) |

**The Agent Factory: From Specification to Sale**

1. **Step 1: Start with a "Spec"** - Write a detailed plan in plain English; this specification becomes your source code
2. **Step 2: Use a General Agent to Build** - A General Agent reads your spec to automatically create custom agents or skills
3. **Step 3: Sell as a "Digital Full-Time Employee" (FTE)** - Price your agent like a virtual employee to highlight its value and massive ROI

**Business Case: Human vs. Digital FTE (GBP):**

| Metric | Human FTE (Average) | Digital FTE (AI Agent) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Availability | 40 hours / week | 168 hours / week (24/7) |
| Monthly Cost | £3,000 - £6,000+ | £400 - £1,500 |
| Scaling | Linear (hire more people) | Exponential (instant duplication) |

## Part 13: Case Studies
<!-- Pages 76-78 -->

### Case Study: The "Digital SDR" Agent
<!-- Pages 76-77 -->

**How a B2B SaaS Startup Replaced a $100k Headcount with a $500/mo Agent Skill**

**The Challenge:** A startup with 5,000 monthly leads was only reaching 15% due to human bandwidth. High churn in SDR (Sales Dev Rep) roles and inconsistent follow-up were killing the pipeline.

**The Solution (Spec-Driven Workflow):**
1. **The Spec:** The founder wrote a Markdown "Spec" detailing the brand voice, objection-handling rules, and qualifying questions
2. **The Builder:** Claude Code consumed the spec and generated a custom Agent Skill folder
3. **The Asset:** A `sales-prospector/` folder containing SKILL.md (instructions) and a `lead_scorer.py` script

**Results:**

| Metric | Human SDR Team | Digital SDR (Agent Skill) |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Volume** | 50 outreaches / day | 1,000+ outreaches / day |
| **Response Time** | 4–6 hours | < 2 minutes |
| **Monthly Cost** | ~$8,200 (Salary + Tools) | $500 (Digital FTE Subscription) |
| **ROI (90 Days)** | Negative (Ramping/Training) | 300% (Instant deployment) |

### Case Study: CoCounsel (Legal Research & Contract Review)
<!-- Page 78 -->

**THE CHALLENGE: The "Justice Gap" & Manual Drudgery**
Lawyers were overwhelmed by volume, charging high hourly rates that 85% of low-income people couldn't afford. High-stakes tasks like "document review" cost clients $1,000 per contract and took days of human time, limiting access to justice and slowing down business deals.

**THE SOLUTION: The First AI Legal Assistant**
Instead of a simple chatbot, they built "CoCounsel"—an agent that performs substantive legal work. It doesn't just "chat"; it plans, researches, and drafts like a human lawyer. It was sold as a "seat" for $500/month (vs. $20/month for basic tools), replacing expensive outsourced work.

**Results:**
- Achieved a **97% pass rate** on complex legal evaluations
- **Acquired for $650 Million** in cash by Thomson Reuters

## Part 14: Implementation Guide
<!-- Pages 79-83 -->

### The "Agent Factory" Roadmap
<!-- Page 79 -->

**Next Steps: Building Your Agent Factory. From Your First Spec to Your First Dollar**

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Day 1-7** | **Identify the "Knowledge Gap"** - Find a task that is high-volume but currently requires "human judgment" (e.g., Code Review, Lead Gen, Legal Intake) |
| **Day 8-14** | **Draft the Spec & Build the Skill** - Use Claude Code to generate your first SKILL.md. Use MCP to connect it to your actual business data (CRM, Slack, Database) |
| **Day 15-21** | **Choose Your Monetization Pillar** - Will you sell this as a Digital FTE to a client? Will you License the Skill folder to an enterprise? |
| **Day 22-30** | **Deploy & Scale** - Use the Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Agents SDK to put your agent into production |

### The AI Agent Value Chain
<!-- Page 80 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Three-stage flow diagram with icons showing manufacture, product, and monetization stages]*

**From Manufacture to Monetization: Transforming knowledge into profitable digital assets**

| Stage | Component | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **MANUFACTURE: The Factory** | General Agents (Claude Code, Goose) & Spec-Driven Dev (SDD) | → Repo-Wide Intelligence |
| **PRODUCT: The Output** | Custom Skills (MCP/SKILL.md), Custom Agents (OpenAI/Claude SDK) & End-to-End Solutions | |
| **MONETIZATION: The Market** | LinkedIn (ROI Selling), Freelance Platforms (Project/Retainer) & Success Fee Model | |

### Golden Rule
<!-- Page 81 -->

> **In the era of Agents, your Spec is your Source Code. If you can describe the excellence you want, AI can build the agent, skills, and MCP to deliver it for any domain.**

### The Blueprint for a Perfect Agent Spec
<!-- Pages 82-83 -->

**The Anatomy of a High-Value Spec**
*What to Include to Ensure Claude Code Generates a "Senior-Level" Skill*

A "Spec" isn't just a prompt; it's a technical requirement document. Use this 6-point checklist before you run the build command.

**1. The Identity (Persona)**
- [ ] **Role:** Define the job title (e.g., "Senior Forensic Accountant")
- [ ] **Tone:** Specify the communication style (e.g., "Concise, professional, and skeptical of anomalies")

**2. The Context (MCP & Data)**
- [ ] **Tool Access:** List the specific MCP Servers the agent must use (e.g., "Access stripe-mcp for transaction history")
- [ ] **Knowledge Base:** Point to the specific folders or documentation the agent should "study"

**3. The Logic (Deterministic Guardrails)**
- [ ] **Mandatory Steps:** Use "First, Then, Finally" logic
- [ ] **The "Never" List:** Hard constraints (e.g., "Never approve a refund over $500 without a human-in-the-loop")
- [ ] **External Scripts:** Identify where Python/Bash should handle math or file formatting instead of the LLM

**4. The Success Trigger (The "Trigger" in SKILL.md)**
- [ ] **Keywords:** What specific phrases should make Claude say, "I have a skill for this"?
- [ ] **File Types:** Does this skill activate for .pdf, .csv, or .json?

**5. The Output Standard (Standardization)**
- [ ] **Template:** Provide a Markdown or JSON schema for the final result
- [ ] **Reporting:** Define how the agent should notify the user (e.g., "Post a summary to #finance-alerts in Slack")

**6. The Error Protocol**
- [ ] **Fallback:** What should the agent do if the MCP tool is down or data is missing?

---

## Part 15: Security & Compliance
<!-- Pages 84-87 -->

### Security and Compliance Framework
<!-- Page 84 -->

**Non-negotiables for enterprise AI agent deployment**

**SECURITY LAYERS:**

| Layer | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. DATA ENCRYPTION** | AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, key rotation every 90 days |
| **2. ACCESS CONTROL** | RBAC/ABAC policies, MFA required, least privilege principle |
| **3. AUDIT LOGGING** | Immutable logs, 7-year retention, real-time anomaly detection |
| **4. INPUT VALIDATION** | Prompt injection prevention, content filtering, rate limiting |

**COMPLIANCE:**
- **EU AI Act (2025):** High-risk AI requires conformity assessments and human oversight documentation

> Consult legal counsel for jurisdiction-specific compliance requirements.

### When NOT to Use AI Agents
<!-- Page 85 -->

**Strategic restraint is as important as bold adoption**

**DO NOT USE AI AGENTS FOR:**

| Scenario | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **IRREVERSIBLE HIGH-STAKES DECISIONS** | Medical diagnoses, legal judgments, large financial approvals without human review |
| **UNDEFINED SUCCESS CRITERIA** | Cannot measure success means cannot validate performance or detect failure |
| **UNSTABLE DATA ENVIRONMENTS** | Rapidly changing schemas, poor data quality, or missing audit trails |
| **RELATIONSHIP-CRITICAL INTERACTIONS** | Executive communications, crisis management, sensitive HR matters |

**Decision Checklist:**
1. Can a human review within SLA?
2. Is the error cost acceptable?
3. Are rollback procedures defined?
4. Is training data representative?

> If any is **No** - pause and redesign

**PRO TIP:** Start with **shadow mode** - agent recommends but humans execute. Graduate after 95%+ accuracy over 30 days.

> Goal is sustainable automation, not maximum automation. Strategic restraint protects long-term value.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
<!-- Page 86 -->

**The top 6 failure modes in AI agent deployment**

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **1. Over-Automating Too Fast** | Start with 1-2 low-risk processes. Prove value before scaling |
| **2. Ignoring Edge Cases** | Document exceptions upfront. Build escalation paths for every decision branch |
| **3. No Monitoring or Alerting** | Implement observability from day 1. Track accuracy, latency, and cost per task |
| **4. Vendor Lock-In** | Build abstraction layers for portability. Panaversity is working on it |
| **5. Underestimating Change Management** | Train affected teams early. Position AI as augmentation, not replacement |
| **6. No Success Metrics Defined** | Define KPIs before building. Measure: time saved, error rate, cost, satisfaction |

> **80% of AI agent failures stem from organizational issues, not technical ones. Plan for people first.**

### Team Structure for AI Implementation
<!-- Page 87 -->

**The roles you need for successful AI agent deployment**

**CORE TEAM (Required):**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **AI Product Owner** | Owns roadmap, prioritizes use cases, defines success metrics |
| **Agent Engineer** | Builds skills, prompts, workflows; integrates MCP |
| **Domain Expert** | Provides business logic, validates outputs, trains edge cases |

**EXTENDED TEAM (Scale):**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Security/Compliance Lead** | Audits, access controls, regulatory alignment |
| **MLOps Engineer** | Monitoring, deployment pipelines, cost optimization |
| **Change Manager** | Training, adoption tracking, resistance management |

**Team Size by Stage:**

| Stage | Team Size |
|-------|-----------|
| POC / Pilot | 2-3 |
| Production | 4-6 |
| Enterprise Scale | 8-12 |

> **Rule of thumb:** 1 Agent Engineer per 3-5 production agents. Start small with core team.

### Competitive Landscape: AI Agent Platforms
<!-- Page 88 -->

**Platform selection guide for enterprise deployment (2026)**

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Claude Code + Spec Kit Plus for development → OpenAI/Claude Agent SDK for production

**2026 TREND:**

## Part 16: Scaling to Global Markets
<!-- Pages 90-95 -->

### How to Reach the Global Market?
<!-- Page 90 -->

Here are the concluding slides of the presentation, designed to bridge the gap between building a product and dominating a global vertical market and establish Unicorn AI Startups.

### The Enterprise North Star: The Digital FTE
<!-- Page 91 -->

**The Way Forward: Developing Digital FTEs for the Enterprise**
*Shifting from "Tools" to "Teammates"*

**The Objective:** Our goal is not just to build software, but to deploy Digital Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) that sit alongside human teams.

**The Construction Stack:**
- **The Architect:** Claude Code (General Agent) designs the logic
- **The Framework:** OpenAI Agents SDK provides the custom runtime
- **The Intelligence:** Agent Skills (SKILL.md) provide the expertise
- **The Connectivity:** MCP Servers provide the real-world data access

**The Outcome:** A secure, specialized, and autonomous employee that works 24/7.

> "We've seen how to build the brain and the hands. But the true value for an enterprise isn't a new app—it's an FTE. We are building digital teammates that can be deployed instantly into any corporate workflow."

### The Scaling Paradox
<!-- Pages 92-93 -->

**The Billion-Dollar Question: How Do We Scale?**
*Reaching Millions of Enterprises with Limited Resources*

**The Barrier:** Traditional enterprise sales and infrastructure are slow and expensive.

**The Challenge:**
1. **Distribution:** How do we put our Digital FTEs in front of decision-makers globally?
2. **Scalability:** How can a small team support 1,000,000+ businesses simultaneously?

**The Reality:** To build a Unicorn, we must decouple our human effort from our global reach.

> "To build a billion-dollar company, you must stop hiring people to grow. You need to make sure your company can reach millions of customers without needing a massive team to do the manual work."

### Distribution: The OpenAI Apps Ecosystem
<!-- Page 94 -->

**Reaching 800 Million Users via OpenAI Apps**
*The Global Marketplace for Digital FTEs*

**Link:** https://chatgpt.com/apps

**Instant Visibility:** OpenAI Apps provide a direct pipeline to:
- 800+ Million individual users
- 1+ Million businesses already using the OpenAI ecosystem

**The "App Store" Moment:** Just as the App Store created the Mobile Economy, OpenAI Apps is creating the Agent Economy.

**Low Friction:** Enterprises can discover and "hire" your Digital FTE with a single click, bypassing traditional 6-month sales cycles.

> "We don't need a sales team of 500 people. We leverage the world's most powerful AI distribution engine. By placing our Custom Agents on the OpenAI platform, we are standing in front of a million businesses on day one."

### Reliability: The Cloud Native Backbone
<!-- Page 95 -->

**Scaling via Cloud Native Technologies**
*Designing for Infinite Growth and Enterprise Security*

**The Foundation:** We use Cloud Native (Kubernetes, Docker, Dapr, Serverless) to host our agents.

**Why Cloud Native?**
- **Auto-Scaling:** Your infrastructure grows automatically as you sign up the next 100,000 enterprises
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Keep enterprise data isolated and secure at a massive scale
- **High Availability:** Ensure your Digital FTEs never "go home" or experience downtime

**Economic Leverage:** Pay only for the compute you use on any cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean), keeping margins high.

## Part 17: Technical Architecture
<!-- Pages 96-104 -->

### Dual Channel Strategy
<!-- Page 96 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Central hexagonal icon with two arrows pointing to: Channel 1 (browser window) and Channel 2 (ChatGPT/OpenAI logo)]*

**"Our Digital FTEs operate across two primary channels."**

To maximise reach and utility, we have engineered a dual frontend strategy, allowing users to interact with our Digital FTEs via our own platform or within the ChatGPT ecosystem.

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Channel 1: Web Frontend** | A dedicated, controlled experience built with Next.js and the OpenAI Chatkit |
| **Channel 2: OpenAI Apps** | Integrated directly inside ChatGPT, leveraging its user base and interface |

### Web Frontend Architecture

### OpenAI App Architecture
<!-- Page 98 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Three-stage flow diagram]*

**"The OpenAI App architecture leverages the reasoning power of ChatGPT."**

```
User → ChatGPT Interface → App Tools → FastAPI Backend
```

**Key Distinction:** In this architecture, the complex reasoning is handled by ChatGPT itself, while our backend provides the specific tools and data access.

### Dual-Backend System
<!-- Page 99 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Two-column comparison with gear icons]*

**"The engine room: A dual-backend system for flexibility and control."**

The heart of our architecture is a strategic separation of backend types. This allows us to precisely balance intelligence with operational cost.

| Deterministic Backend (Zero LLM) | Hybrid Backend |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| No LLM calls | Uses LLM calls |
| Predictable, low cost, high control | Higher intelligence, higher cost |

### Zero LLM Backend
<!-- Page 100 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Intricate clockwork mechanism blueprint showing complex interconnected gears]*

**"The 'Zero LLM' backend is our foundation for scale and compliance."**

This backend processes requests using deterministic logic without making calls to a large language model. All sophisticated reasoning is deliberately kept on the frontend (e.g., in ChatGPT or Claude).

**Best Suited For:**
- Cost-conscious applications
- High-volume usage scenarios
- Workloads requiring strict compliance and control

### Hybrid Backend
<!-- Page 101 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Complex gear mechanism with organic leaf-like elements and lock icons]*

**"The Hybrid Backend is reserved for monetised, premium features."**

This backend selectively uses LLM calls to perform tasks that require a higher degree of intelligence and nuance.

**Used For Premium Features:**
- Deep analysis of complex data
- Synthesis of multiple information sources
- Advanced personalisation

> **The Business Rule:** Access to the Hybrid Backend is always gated and monetised.

### Cost Discipline Principle
<!-- Page 102 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Three icons with descriptions - box/foundation, key, growth chart]*

**"Our entire architecture is governed by a principle of radical cost discipline."**

1. **Zero LLM by default.** This is our baseline for all Digital FTEs, ensuring a **low** and **predictable** cost structure.

2. **Hybrid LLM** usage is a deliberate, **selective** choice, reserved exclusively for **premium**, value-added capabilities.

3. This disciplined approach enables the creation of truly **sustainable** Digital FTEs, avoiding the unpredictable and often prohibitive costs of unrestrained LLM usage.

### Scalable Ecosystem Result
<!-- Page 103 - Visual Description -->

*[VISUAL: Symmetrical diagram with central crystalline/organic pattern connected via pipes and gears to various components on both sides]*

**"The result: A scalable ecosystem of intelligent, cost-effective Digital FTEs."**

Our architecture-first strategy delivers a new class of AI worker that can:
- ✓ **Augment** or **replace** real-world knowledge roles effectively
- ✓ Run **seamlessly** across both dedicated web applications and the ChatGPT platform
- ✓ **Intelligently balance** advanced AI intelligence with strict economic discipline

### Complete Architecture Summary

**"The Architecture of a Digital FTE: Building structured, cost-effective AI workers"**

**DEFINING THE DIGITAL FTE:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **A Structured AI Worker** | Has a defined role, uses tools, operates continuously, and has predictable costs |
| **Core Technology Stack** | Claude for intelligence, FastAPI for backends, Cloud-native infrastructure |
| **Dual Frontend Access** | Dedicated Web Frontend + App inside ChatGPT |

**THE CORE STRATEGY: TWO BACKEND ARCHITECTURES**

| Deterministic Backend (Zero LLM) | Hybrid Backend |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| The default choice | The premium choice |
| No LLM calls for maximum predictability, control, and low cost | Uses LLM calls selectively for higher intelligence and deep analysis |
| **PRIMARY GOAL:** Cost Efficiency & Control | **PRIMARY GOAL:** Advanced Intelligence |
| **BUSINESS MODEL:** Default, core functionality | **BUSINESS MODEL:** Gated, monetised premium features |

<!-- Pages 105-109 -->

### Glossary of Key Terms
<!-- Page 105 -->

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **AI Agent** | Software that pursues goals autonomously by observing, deciding, acting, and learning in a loop |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Universal protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools, databases, and APIs |
| **SKILL.md** | Markdown file containing instructions, logic, and workflows that teach an agent a specific capability |
| **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** | Methodology where detailed specifications are written first, then AI generates code to meet them |
| **General Agent** | Flexible agent (Claude Code, Goose) that handles diverse tasks with zero-shot planning. Builder tool |
| **Custom Agent** | Purpose-built agent (via SDK) optimized for specific workflows with guardrails. Production tool |
| **Digital FTE** | AI agent priced/sold as equivalent to a full-time employee. Works 168 hrs/week vs human's 40 |
| **Agent Factory** | System using General Agents + Specs to manufacture Custom Skills and Agents at scale |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | Pattern where humans review/approve agent decisions for high-stakes or edge case scenarios |
| **Shadow Mode** | Deployment pattern where agent runs in parallel with humans, outputs compared but not acted upon |
| **Guardrails** | Hard constraints defining what an agent can/cannot do. Essential for production safety |
| **Orchestration** | Coordinating multiple agents/skills to complete complex multi-step workflows |

### Core Insights
<!-- Page 106 -->

**Key takeaways from the research:**

- Work will be a partnership of people, agents, and robots
- Automation transforms work, doesn't eliminate it
- Most human skills remain relevant but evolve
- AI fluency is the fastest-growing workforce requirement
- Workflow redesign unlocks greater value than task automation

### Final Summary of the Presentation Flow
