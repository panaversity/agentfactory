Rename folder from `03-billion-dollar-ai/` to `03-digital-fte-strategy/`\n2. Restructure from 8 lessons to 10 lessons\n3. Add 2 NEW lessons:\n   - Lesson 5: \"Four Monetization Models\" (from slides Part 11)\n   - Lesson 8: \"When NOT to Use AI Agents\" (from slides Part 15)\n\n### Lesson Updates\n1. Lesson 1: Reframe from \"Billion Dollar Question\" to \"Your Expertise as Product\" - remove redundancy with Ch1, add personal application focus\n2. Lesson 2: Keep \"Snakes and Ladders\" - minor terminology alignment\n3. Lesson 3: Reframe from \"Super Orchestrators\" to \"The FTE Advantage\" - remove Digital FTE table (now in Ch1 L10), add sales presentation tips\n4. Lesson 4: Significant update to \"Vertical Intelligence\" - add Agent Skills/SKILL.md content from slides\n5. Lesson 5: NEW \"Four Monetization Models\" - Subscription, Success Fee, License, Marketplace\n6. Lesson 6: Keep \"PPP Strategy\" - minor edits\n7. Lesson 7: Keep \"Three Requirements\" (renumbered from 6)\n8. Lesson 8: NEW \"When NOT to Use AI Agents\" - security, compliance, common pitfalls\n9. Lesson 9: Update \"Pause and Reflect\" - new monetization-focused prompts\n10. Lesson 10: Update Quiz - add 15 new questions on monetization, Agent Skills, guardrails\n\n### Content Sources\n- Agent Factory slides Part 11 (Pages 63-64): Monetization models\n- Agent Factory slides Part 15 (Pages 84-87): Security, compliance, pitfalls\n- Agent Factory slides Part 6 (Pages 37-50): Agent Skills/SKILL.md\n- Agent Factory slides Part 12 (Pages 71-73): Digital FTE economics, sales tips\n\n### Success Criteria\n- Zero redundancy with Chapter 1 content\n- All 4 monetization models clearly explained with examples\n- Agent Skills/SKILL.md format documented\n- \"When NOT to use\" guardrails included\n- Quiz covers new content areas\n- All .summary.md files regenerated\n\n### Non-Goals\n- Not restructuring other chapters\n- Not adding code examples (conceptual chapter)\n- Not changing the fundamental Snakes & Ladders or PPP frameworks\n\n### Dependencies\n- Chapter 1 Agent Factory Paradigm (completed)\n- Chapter 2 AIFF Foundation (#385 - in progress, but independent)","event":"invoke","source":"Skill_tool"}
