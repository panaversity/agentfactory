HIGH Priority - Resolve I1 and I2: Update spec.md to change \"10 lessons\" to \"11 lessons\" in FR-002, SC-001, SC-007. This is a minor edit to align spec with plan's justified expansion.\n  2. MEDIUM Priority - Add C1: Insert build verification task after Phase 2 README update.\n  3. LOW Priority - Documentation: Ensure tasks reference absolute file path for Agent Factory source document.\n  4. Proceed with implementation: No critical blockers. HIGH issues are documentation alignment, not conceptual problems. The plan's expansion from 10 to 11 lessons is well-justified (cognitive load distribution for monetization).\n\n  ---\n  Verdict: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION with minor documentation updates.\n\n  The spec-plan-tasks triad is well-aligned. The 10→11 lesson expansion is justified and should be reflected in the spec. No fundamental conflicts or missing coverage detected.\n\n  ---\n  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the HIGH priority items (updating spec.md to reflect 11 lessons)?\n\n> autonoimsly complete it \n\n⏺ I'll proceed autonomously.
