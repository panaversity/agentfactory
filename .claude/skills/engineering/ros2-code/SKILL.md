# ROS 2 Code Skill

**Purpose**: Generate correct, educational ROS 2 code examples using rclpy.

## When to Use

- Creating ROS 2 node examples
- Generating publisher/subscriber patterns
- Writing service/action examples
- Creating launch files

## Code Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Node | Basic ROS 2 node structure |
| Publisher | Sending messages to topics |
| Subscriber | Receiving messages from topics |
| Service | Request/response patterns |
| Action | Long-running tasks with feedback |
| Launch | Multi-node orchestration |

## Output Requirements

- Python code using rclpy
- Proper type hints
- Educational comments explaining each section
- Expected output shown
- MockROS compatibility for Tier 1

## Integration

- Used by lesson-generator for Module 1 (ROS 2) content
- Works with pyodide-exercise for browser execution
- Compatible with MockROSBridge for simulation
