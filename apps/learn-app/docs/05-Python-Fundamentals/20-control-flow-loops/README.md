# Chapter 20: Control Flow and Loops

Programs need to make decisions and repeat actions. Should we process this user's order or reject it? Should we retry a failed network request? Should we validate every item in a list? Control flow structures answer these questions by letting your code respond to different conditions and automate repetitive tasks.

Control flow structures are the foundation of programming logic—they let your code respond to different conditions and automate repetitive tasks. You'll master conditional statements, pattern matching, loops, and control mechanisms that transform simple scripts into intelligent programs.

## Chapter Contribution to Todo App

This chapter contributes: **Task menu logic and iteration**

By the end of this chapter, your todo application will have a working menu system (if/elif/else), display all tasks in a loop, and respond to user choices—the core interaction pattern for any command-line application.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Make decisions in code** using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- **Use pattern matching** with Python's modern `match-case` syntax
- **Automate repetition** using `for` and `while` loops
- **Control loop behavior** with `break`, `continue`, and loop-else patterns
- **Combine decisions and loops** to solve complex problems
- **Describe your intent clearly** so AI can help you write correct control flow logic
- **Validate your logic** by testing edge cases and understanding execution flow
