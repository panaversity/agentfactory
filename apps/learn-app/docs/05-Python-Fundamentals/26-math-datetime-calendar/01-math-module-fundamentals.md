# Math Module Fundamentals

When you need precision, Python's `math` module is your foundation. Whether calculating circle areas, finding square roots, or rounding currency amounts, the math module provides reliable, accurate operations beyond what built-in functions offer.

In this lesson, you'll learn when to reach for the math module, how to validate your inputs, and how to work with Python 3.14's enhanced error messages that make debugging mathematical problems much clearer.

## Built-In vs. Module Functions: When to Import

Python gives you some basic math operations for free. The `abs()` function, `round()`, `pow()`, `max()`, and `min()` all work without imports:

```python
# These don't need imports—they're built-in
result: int = abs(-42)
rounded: int = round(3.7)
powered: int = pow(2, 3)
largest: int = max(5, 10, 3)
```

But when you need more specialized operations—like square roots, trigonometry, or logarithms—you import the `math` module:

```python
import math

result: float = math.sqrt(16)  # 4.0
angle: float = math.sin(1.57)  # Roughly 1.0 (90 degrees in radians)
logarithm: float = math.log(10)  # Natural logarithm
```

Why the split? Python keeps the core language lightweight and puts specialized tools in modules you import when needed. It's a design philosophy: you get what you need, nothing more.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

## Square Roots with Validation: Your First Error Handling

The square root function `math.sqrt()` seems simple until you try to break it. Give it a negative number:

```python
import math

try:
    result: float = math.sqrt(-1)
except ValueError as error:
    print(f"Math domain error: {error}")
```

Python 3.14 gives you enhanced error messages that explain exactly what went wrong:

```
Math domain error: math domain error
```

This message—while terse—represents something important: **domain errors** happen when you ask a function to do something mathematically impossible. Negative numbers don't have real square roots, so Python stops you.

Here's a proper pattern with validation:

```python
import math

def safe_sqrt(value: float) -> float | None:
    """Calculate square root with validation.

    Args:
        value: Number to find square root of

    Returns:
        Square root as float, or None if validation fails
    """
    if value < 0:
        print(f"Error: Cannot calculate square root of {value} (negative number)")
        return None

    return math.sqrt(value)

# Test it
print(safe_sqrt(16))      # 4.0
print(safe_sqrt(-9))      # Error: Cannot calculate... | None
print(safe_sqrt(2.25))    # 1.5
```

The key insight: **validation before operation**. Check your inputs first, handle errors gracefully, and give users clear feedback.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize every function's constraints—you understand the principle: some operations are mathematically impossible. You ask AI to help you understand error messages and explain *why* an operation failed. Syntax is cheap; understanding mathematical validity is gold.

## Rounding: Three Different Strategies

Rounding seems straightforward until you compare the options:

```python
value: float = 2.5

print(round(value))       # 2 (rounds to nearest even—banker's rounding)
print(math.ceil(value))   # 3 (always rounds up)
print(math.floor(value))  # 2 (always rounds down)
```

Wait—`round(2.5)` returns `2`, not `3`? Yes. Python uses "banker's rounding": when exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the nearest even number. This minimizes bias in large datasets.

But `ceil()` and `floor()` are predictable:

```python
import math

# Testing different values
test_values: list[float] = [2.1, 2.5, 2.9, -2.1, -2.5, -2.9]

for val in test_values:
    print(f"{val:>4} → round: {round(val)}, ceil: {math.ceil(val)}, floor: {math.floor(val)}")
```

Output:
```
 2.1 → round: 2, ceil: 3, floor: 2
 2.5 → round: 2, ceil: 3, floor: 2
 2.9 → round: 3, ceil: 3, floor: 2
-2.1 → round: -2, ceil: -2, floor: -3
-2.5 → round: -2, ceil: -2, floor: -3
-2.9 → round: -3, ceil: -2, floor: -3
```

Notice how negative numbers behave: `ceil()` moves *toward* zero, `floor()` moves *away* from zero.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "I'm building a pricing system where amounts under $0.01 should round up (use ceil), but final totals should use standard rounding. Generate a function that handles both cases with type hints and explain why different rounding strategies exist."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand that the choice of rounding function affects real-world outcomes—especially important in financial calculations.

## Mathematical Constants: Precision Matters

Here's a tempting mistake:

```python
# DON'T do this
circumference: float = 2 * 3.14159 * radius

# DO this instead
import math
circumference: float = 2 * math.pi * radius
```

Why? Precision. `math.pi` is far more accurate than any hardcoded approximation. Here's the difference:

```python
import math

radius: float = 10.0

# Using hardcoded value
approx_area: float = 3.14159 * (radius ** 2)

# Using math.pi
precise_area: float = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

print(f"Hardcoded: {approx_area}")
print(f"math.pi:   {precise_area}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(approx_area - precise_area)}")
```

Output:
```
Hardcoded: 314.159
math.pi:   314.1592653589793
Difference: 0.0002653589793...
```

For a circle with radius 10, the difference is tiny. But for large calculations, small errors compound.

Python's math module provides three key constants:

```python
import math

print(f"π (pi):   {math.pi}")      # 3.141592653589793
print(f"e:        {math.e}")       # 2.718281828459045
print(f"τ (tau):  {math.tau}")     # 6.283185307179586 (equals 2π)
```

Use them to understand *what* they represent:

- **π (pi)**: Ratio of circle's circumference to diameter—use for circles
- **e**: Base of natural logarithm—use for exponential growth and compound interest
- **τ (tau)**: Full rotation (2π)—use when thinking about full circles instead of half

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

## Type Hints for Mathematical Functions

Every mathematical function needs clear type information:

```python
import math

def circle_area(radius: float) -> float:
    """Calculate circle area using math.pi.

    Args:
        radius: Circle radius (must be positive)

    Returns:
        Area of circle
    """
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Radius cannot be negative: {radius}")

    return math.pi * (radius ** 2)


def hypotenuse(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Calculate hypotenuse of right triangle using Pythagorean theorem.

    Args:
        a: First side length
        b: Second side length

    Returns:
        Length of hypotenuse
    """
    return math.sqrt((a ** 2) + (b ** 2))


# Using the functions
print(circle_area(5))        # 78.53981633974483
print(hypotenuse(3, 4))      # 5.0
```

Type hints serve three purposes:

1. **Clarity**: Anyone reading your code knows what values to pass
2. **Validation**: Your IDE or type checker catches mistakes before runtime
3. **Documentation**: Hints replace half your docstring

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Why do we use `float` instead of `int` for mathematical operations like sqrt and circle area? What happens if you try to use integers?"

## Python 3.14's Enhanced Domain Error Messages

When operations fail mathematically, Python 3.14 helps you understand why. Let's explore:

```python
import math

# This will fail—negative number has no real square root
try:
    result = math.sqrt(-1)
except ValueError as error:
    print(f"Error type: {type(error).__name__}")
    print(f"Message: {error}")
    # Output: Message: math domain error
```

Python 3.14's enhanced error messages are clearer than in earlier versions. When you encounter a domain error, it means:

- **Square root**: Input must be ≥ 0
- **Logarithm**: Input must be > 0
- **Arc sine/cosine**: Input must be between -1 and 1
- **Division by zero**: Denominator cannot be 0

The pattern: **understand the constraint, validate before operating, handle errors gracefully**.

```python
import math

def safe_log(value: float) -> float | None:
    """Calculate natural logarithm with validation.

    Args:
        value: Number to find log of (must be > 0)

    Returns:
        Natural logarithm, or None if validation fails
    """
    if value <= 0:
        print(f"Error: Cannot calculate log of {value} (must be positive)")
        return None

    return math.log(value)


# Test boundary cases
print(safe_log(1))     # 0.0 (log of 1 is always 0)
print(safe_log(2.718)) # ~1.0 (log of e is 1)
print(safe_log(0))     # Error: Cannot calculate... | None
print(safe_log(-5))    # Error: Cannot calculate... | None
```

This is validation-first thinking: check inputs, understand constraints, communicate clearly when operations fail.
