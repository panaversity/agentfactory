# Chapter 8: AI-Native IDEs - Zed, Cursor, Antigravity, and the Future of Development

**Part 2: AI Tool Landscape** | **Proficiency Level**: A2-B1 | **Duration**: 6-8 hours

## Overview

This chapter introduces modern development environments designed from the ground up for AI collaboration. You'll explore three distinct approaches to AI-native IDEs: **Zed** (performance-focused), **Cursor** (VS Code evolution), and **Antigravity** (agent control plane architecture).

## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the architectural distinction between AI-native IDEs and traditional editors with plugins
2. **Install and configure** at least one AI-native IDE (Zed, Cursor, or Antigravity) on your system
3. **Guide AI** to complete coding tasks using natural language prompts across multiple IDEs
4. **Apply selection criteria** (performance, features, collaboration, ecosystem) to choose appropriate IDEs for different projects
5. **Compare AI-native IDEs** through hands-on observation, documenting workflow differences
6. **Critically evaluate** AI-generated code for correctness, security, and quality
