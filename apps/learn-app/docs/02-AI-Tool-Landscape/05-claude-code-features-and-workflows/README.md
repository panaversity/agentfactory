# Chapter 5: Claude Code: Your First General Agent

You know *why* AI-driven development matters—and that it's happening right now, in 2025. But understanding transformation and experiencing it are two different things.

This chapter introduces you to **Claude Code**—not just a coding tool, but a **General Agent**. What's a General Agent? An AI that can reason through problems, make plans, and take action across any domain. Calling Claude Code a "coding agent" is like calling a CEO an "email writer"—code is just how it controls your computer.

The goal is **not to build a supercomputer**, but to establish Claude Code as your **collaborative thinking partner** for everything—and to build Skills that can become products.

## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll have:

- **General Agents Explained** — Understanding why Claude Code is fundamentally different from coding assistants: the OODA reasoning loop, the "Trojan Horse" insight, and code as a universal interface to any domain
- **Claude Code Installed & Working** — Complete setup with **two professional paths**: Official Claude Max subscription (Lesson 2) OR Free Google Gemini backend (Lesson 3). Both teach identical Claude Code skills
- **Persistent Project Context** — Creating CLAUDE.md files that eliminate repetitive context-sharing in every session
- **External Integration** — MCP servers for safe access to external systems (web, APIs, docs) with practical Playwright and Context7 workflows
- **Token Optimization** — Compiling MCP servers to Skills for 80-98% token reduction through code execution patterns and progressive disclosure
- **Subagent Orchestration** — Recognizing when Claude automatically delegates to Explore agent (codebase search) or Plan mode (complex tasks) with hands-on exercises
- **Autonomous Expertise** — Agent Skills with progressive disclosure pattern (metadata → full definition → supporting files) and autonomous discovery
- **Skill Factory Pattern** — Using skill-creator to generate skills efficiently, building integrated skill systems, and understanding meta-skill concepts
- **Event-Driven Automation** — Hooks for custom behaviors triggered by events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart) with hands-on SessionStart hook creation
- **Configuration Mastery** — Settings hierarchy (User, Project, Local) and precedence rules for team collaboration and personal customization
- **Complete Extensibility** — Discovering and using plugins from marketplaces, hands-on installation of Anthropic's official skills repository
- **From Skills to Business** — Understanding how Skills become monetizable products, the Digital FTE model, four revenue approaches, and the path from expertise to enterprise
