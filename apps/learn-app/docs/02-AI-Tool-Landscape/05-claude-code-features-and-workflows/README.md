# Chapter 5: Claude Code: The AI Partner Phenomenon

You know *why* AI-driven development matters—and that it's happening right now, in 2025. But understanding transformation and experiencing it are two different things.

This chapter introduces you to the first real tool you'll use: Claude Code. Not as abstract theory, but as a working development partner on your machine. The goal is **not to build a supercomputer**, but to establish Claude Code as your **collaborative thinking partner** for everything.

## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll have:

- **The Paradigm Shift** — Understanding how agentic AI (Claude Code) differs fundamentally from passive chat-based tools through context-aware, file-integrated collaboration
- **Claude Code Installed & Working** — Complete setup with **two professional paths**: Official Claude Max subscription (Lesson 2) OR Free Google Gemini backend (Lesson 3). Both teach identical Claude Code skills
- **Persistent Project Context** — Creating CLAUDE.md files that eliminate repetitive context-sharing in every session
- **External Integration** — MCP servers for safe access to external systems (web, APIs, docs) with practical Playwright and Context7 workflows
- **Subagent Orchestration** — Recognizing when Claude automatically delegates to Explore agent (codebase search) or Plan mode (complex tasks) with hands-on exercises
- **Autonomous Expertise** — Agent Skills with progressive disclosure pattern (metadata → full definition → supporting files) and autonomous discovery
- **Event-Driven Automation** — Hooks for custom behaviors triggered by events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart) with hands-on SessionStart hook creation
- **Configuration Mastery** — Settings hierarchy (User, Project, Local) and precedence rules for team collaboration and personal customization
- **Complete Extensibility** — Discovering and using plugins from marketplaces, hands-on installation of Anthropic's official skills repository
