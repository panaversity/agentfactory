### Core Concept
Claude Code represents a paradigm shift from passive AI assistance (copy-paste from chat) to agentic AI collaboration—where AI reads your actual files, proposes specific changes to your codebase, and executes with your approval.

### Key Mental Models
- **Passive vs. Agentic**: Chat AI is a consultant giving generic advice; agentic AI is a pair programmer collaborating on your actual code with full project context
- **Context is Everything**: AI without file access starts from zero context every interaction; AI with file access understands your project structure, dependencies, and patterns
- **Friction Removal > Feature Addition**: The value isn't faster coding—it's eliminating context-switching, copy-paste workflows, and manual integration so you can focus on creative problem-solving

### Critical Patterns
- Agentic workflow: describe task → Claude reads files → proposes specific changes → you approve → Claude executes
- Terminal integration enables: direct file system access, real-time execution and error handling, Git integration, and developer workflow alignment
- Trust through transparency: see exact diffs before approving file changes, see command outputs in real-time

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking agentic AI replaces developers (it removes friction from execution, not the creative work of designing solutions)
- Assuming terminal-based means harder to use (terminal integration removes context-switching friction that browser-based AI creates)
- Continuing to copy-paste context into chat AI when context-aware tools would see your actual code

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Basic understanding of AI assistants and terminal usage
- **Leads to**: Practical Claude Code workflows, configuration with CLAUDE.md, and hands-on usage patterns
