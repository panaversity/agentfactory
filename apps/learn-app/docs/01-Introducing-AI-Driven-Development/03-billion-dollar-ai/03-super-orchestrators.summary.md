### Core Concept
The 90-10 rule explains why solo entrepreneurs can now build billion-dollar value: AI handles 90% of mechanical work (code, workflows, data transformations) while humans provide the 10% that matters—strategic judgment about what to build, for whom, and why.

### Key Mental Models
- **90-10 Split**: Most work is mechanical and delegable; human value concentrates in judgment calls
- **Value-Per-Employee Economics**: Instagram ($77M/employee) and WhatsApp ($345M/employee) proved small teams create massive value when mechanical work is outsourced
- **Attention Bottleneck**: Revenue scales with decisions, not with team size—infrastructure serves 100 or 1,000 customers equally

### Critical Patterns
- Delegate the 90% (code generation, bug fixes, deployment) to AI agents
- Protect the 10% (market understanding, customer relationships, strategic prioritization)
- Scale through subagents, not headcount—deploy specialized AI agents per vertical instead of hiring engineers
- Revenue compounds through customer lifetime value, not linear effort

### Common Mistakes
- Believing "more code = more value" (traditional thinking; AI-native = better judgment = more value)
- Spending time on mechanical tasks that AI can handle
- Scaling team size proportionally with revenue growth (unnecessary in AI-era economics)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Competitive layers and why orchestration beats commodity services (Lesson 2)
- **Leads to**: The paradigm shift from writing code to designing intelligence (Lesson 4)
