### Core Concept
The traditional billion-dollar playbook—raise $100M+, hire hundreds of engineers, compete against well-funded incumbents—is broken. AI enables solo developers to orchestrate teams of specialized AI agents, achieving scale that was previously impossible without massive resources.

### Key Mental Models
- **Three Forces Convergence**: Capability threshold crossed + mainstream adoption (84% of developers) + economic shift = compound opportunity. When independent forces align, opportunity multiplies.
- **Solo Scaling Through Orchestration**: One developer coordinating AI agents can now match workflows that would have required entire engineering teams two years ago.
- **Broken Playbook = Open Door**: When traditional rules stop working, newcomers gain advantage over incumbents who optimized for old rules.

### Critical Patterns
- Track the three forces: technical (tools work), social (developers adopted), financial (ROI is immediate)
- AI agents are "production-ready development partners," not toys or experiments
- The path from "possible" to "proven at scale" is measured in months, not years

### Common Mistakes
- Believing you need traditional startup resources (large team, VC funding, years of experience) to build valuable software
- Waiting for AI to get "better enough"—the capability threshold has already been crossed
- Assuming more competition means less opportunity (it often creates more adjacent opportunities)
