# Lesson 1: The Agentic AI Foundation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what AAIF is and why it was created
- Name the three founding projects and their origins
- Articulate why open standards matter for building Digital FTEs

## The December 2025 Announcement

On December 9, 2025, the Linux Foundation announced something unprecedented in AI: competitors collaborating on open standards.

The **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** was born—a neutral home where companies, researchers, and developers collaborate on open source agentic AI. The founding contributors? Three of the biggest names in AI:

- **Anthropic** donated the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **OpenAI** donated AGENTS.md
- **Block** (the company behind Square) donated goose

Why does this matter for you? Because the standards governing how AI agents work are now **open and governed neutrally**—not controlled by any single company.

## Why Open Standards Matter

Think about USB cables. Before USB became a standard, every device had its own proprietary connector. Your phone charger wouldn't work with your camera. Your printer needed a special cable. It was chaos.

Then USB standardized device connections. Any USB device works with any USB port. The standard is open—no single company controls it.

**AAIF does the same thing for AI agents.**

Without open standards:
- Your agent skills would only work with one platform
- Your MCP servers would need rewriting for each AI provider
- You'd be locked into whoever you started with

With AAIF governance:
- Write skills once, run them across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and more
- Build MCP servers that work everywhere
- Your Digital FTEs are portable investments, not platform prisoners

## The Three Founding Projects

AAIF launched with three core projects, each solving a different problem:

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) — From Anthropic

**Problem it solves**: How do AI agents connect to external tools and data?

Before MCP, every AI platform had its own integration approach. If you wanted your agent to access Salesforce, you'd write custom code for Claude, different code for ChatGPT, and yet another version for Gemini.

MCP standardizes this. One protocol. Universal connectivity.

*You'll learn MCP in depth in Lesson 2.*

### 2. AGENTS.md — From OpenAI

**Problem it solves**: How do AI agents understand project-specific context?

When an AI agent works on your codebase, how does it know your coding conventions? Your build commands? Your testing requirements?

AGENTS.md is the answer—a markdown file that provides project-specific guidance to any AI agent. Think of it as a README, but for agents.

*You'll learn AGENTS.md in Lesson 3.*

### 3. goose — From Block

**Problem it solves**: What does a working AI agent actually look like?

MCP and AGENTS.md are protocols and formats. goose is a complete, working agent that implements these standards. It's a reference implementation—proof that the standards work at enterprise scale.

Block employees use goose daily, reporting 50-75% time savings on common tasks.

*You'll learn about goose in Lesson 4.*

## Who's Behind AAIF

The founding isn't just three companies. Look at the platinum members:

| Company | Role |
|---------|------|
| Amazon Web Services | Cloud infrastructure leader |
| Anthropic | Claude AI, MCP creator |
| Block | goose creator, Square payment platform |
| Bloomberg | Financial data and AI |
| Cloudflare | Edge computing and security |
| Google | Gemini AI, cloud platform |
| Microsoft | Azure, GitHub Copilot |
| OpenAI | ChatGPT, AGENTS.md creator |

These are competitors. They compete fiercely in the AI market. Yet they agreed on one thing: **the infrastructure for agents should be open.**

As Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation, stated:

> "By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents."

## What This Means for Your Digital FTEs

Remember the Agent Factory vision from Chapter 1? You're building Digital FTEs—AI agents that own specific functions and generate recurring revenue.

AAIF standards are the foundation of those Digital FTEs:

| Standard | Digital FTE Capability |
|----------|----------------------|
| **MCP** | Enables your FTE to connect to business tools (CRM, databases, APIs) |
| **AGENTS.md** | Lets your FTE understand any project it works on |
| **Agent Skills** | Packages your domain expertise (covered in Lesson 5) |

Without these standards, your Digital FTE would be locked to one platform. With them, you build once and deploy anywhere.

**Your investment in learning these standards pays dividends across every agent you create.**

## Quick Knowledge Check

Before moving on, make sure you can answer:

1. What is AAIF and who governs it?
2. What are the three founding projects and which companies donated them?
3. Why do open standards matter for building portable Digital FTEs?

## Try With AI

Ask your AI assistant:

> "What is the Agentic AI Foundation?"

Compare the response to what you learned in this lesson. Note that AI models have training cutoffs—your AI might not have data from December 2025 when AAIF was announced.

This is a good reminder: **you now know something current that your AI assistant might not.** As you progress through this book, you'll increasingly encounter situations where your knowledge is more current than your AI tools.

## Summary

- **AAIF** (Agentic AI Foundation) is a Linux Foundation initiative launched December 2025
- **Three founding projects**: MCP (Anthropic), AGENTS.md (OpenAI), goose (Block)
- **Platinum members** include AWS, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI—competitors collaborating on standards
- **Open standards** mean your Digital FTEs are portable, not locked to any platform
- This is the infrastructure layer that enables everything you'll build

## Next Steps

Now that you understand who governs these standards, let's dive into the most important one: the Model Context Protocol. [Continue to Lesson 2: MCP - Connecting Agents to Tools](./02-model-context-protocol.md).
