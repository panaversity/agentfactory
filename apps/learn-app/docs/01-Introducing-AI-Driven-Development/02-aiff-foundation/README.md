# Chapter 2: AIFF Foundation & Agent Standards

## Overview

Chapter 1 gave you the vision: building Digital FTEs that work 24/7 and generate recurring revenue. But how do these agents actually connect to tools, find project context, and package expertise? That's what you'll learn here.

In December 2025, something remarkable happened: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block—competitors in the AI space—came together under the Linux Foundation to create the **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)**. They donated their core standards to neutral governance, ensuring the future of AI agents is open, not locked into proprietary platforms.

This chapter teaches you the **infrastructure layer** that makes Digital FTEs possible.

## What You'll Learn

| Lesson | Standard | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | AAIF | Who governs agentic AI standards |
| 2 | MCP | How agents connect to tools and data |
| 3 | AGENTS.md | How agents find project-specific context |
| 4 | goose | What a real agent looks like in practice |
| 5 | Agent Skills | How to package domain expertise |
| 6 | MCP-UI & Apps SDK | How agent interfaces are evolving |

## The Standards Ecosystem

Think of these standards as layers in your Digital FTE's foundation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Your Digital FTE              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Agent Skills    │  Expertise encoding  │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│  MCP             │  Tool connectivity   │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│  AGENTS.md       │  Project context     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           AAIF Governance               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **AAIF** provides neutral governance so these standards remain open
- **MCP** connects your agent to tools (CRM, databases, APIs)
- **AGENTS.md** gives your agent project-specific knowledge
- **Agent Skills** package your domain expertise into reusable modules

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 1**: Agent Factory Paradigm (Two Paths Framework, Digital FTE vision, Five Powers)

## Time Investment

~90 minutes total (including exercises and quiz)

## Outcome

After this chapter, you'll understand the standards ecosystem well enough to:

- Recognize MCP commands when you see them in later chapters
- Understand skill folder structures
- Articulate how these standards enable the Digital FTEs you'll build
- Explain why open standards matter for your AI products
