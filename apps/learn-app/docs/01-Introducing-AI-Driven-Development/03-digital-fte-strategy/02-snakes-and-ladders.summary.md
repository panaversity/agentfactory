### Core Concept
AI markets operate in four competitive layers, and billion-dollar opportunities emerge from dominating one layer (especially vertical markets) rather than competing head-on at the consumer layer where only well-funded giants survive.

### Key Mental Models
- **Four-Layer Competitive Structure**: Consumer backbone (Layer 1) → Developer tools (Layer 2) → Vertical market subagents (Layer 3) → Orchestration (Layer 4). Each layer has different economics and entry barriers.
- **Snakes vs Ladders**: Consumer AI is a "snake" that pulls you backward (unsustainable economics). Specialized markets are "ladders" that let you skip ahead by avoiding direct competition.
- **Agility Asymmetry**: Incumbents (Bloomberg, Epic Systems, Blackboard) are bound by legacy code, regulatory compliance, and organizational inertia. Solo developers with zero legacy can rebuild entire products in a weekend—this speed difference is your competitive advantage.

### Critical Patterns
- Avoid Layer 1 entirely: it's a two-player war (OpenAI vs Google) requiring billions in compute and marketing
- Start at Layer 2 (specialized developer tools) or Layer 3 (vertical market subagents)
- Target industries with slow-moving incumbents: finance, healthcare, education, legal
- Build vertical dominance first, then integrate upward toward orchestration

### Common Mistakes
- Competing on consumer appeal against entrenched giants (the Windows Mobile mistake)
- Building general-purpose AI tools instead of specialized solutions for specific workflows
- Underestimating how slowly incumbents can respond—their inertia is your opportunity, not a barrier
