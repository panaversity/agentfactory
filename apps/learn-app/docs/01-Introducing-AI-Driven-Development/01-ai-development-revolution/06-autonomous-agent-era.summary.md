### Core Concept
AI coding tools are evolving from assistants to autonomous agents that complete multi-step tasks independently—but human judgment for strategy, trade-offs, and ambiguity remains essential.

### Key Mental Models
- **Four Generations**: Autocomplete (2021) → Function generation (2022) → Feature implementation (2023) → Autonomous agents (2024+). Each generation shifts more execution responsibility to AI.
- **Autonomous Within Boundaries**: Agents self-execute tasks you define but can't make strategic decisions, understand implicit requirements, or exercise judgment about "good enough."
- **Paradigm Shift**: From "developer leads, AI follows" to "human directs strategy, AI manages execution." You move from implementation to orchestration.

### Critical Patterns
- Assess tool generation by asking: "Can you break down a goal, execute steps, run tests, and iterate without my guidance at each step?"
- Agent workflow reduces your active attention (30 minutes vs. 4-8 hours) by handling implementation, testing, and debugging autonomously
- Multi-agent systems use specialized agents (planning, testing, review, documentation) coordinated by an orchestrator—like human team specialization

### Common Mistakes
- Expecting agents to read between the lines—they only know what you explicitly specify
- Confusing "autonomous" with "unsupervised"—it's cruise control, not self-driving to an unknown destination
- Waiting for better tools instead of building skills now—specification writing, architecture thinking, and code review matter regardless of tool generation
