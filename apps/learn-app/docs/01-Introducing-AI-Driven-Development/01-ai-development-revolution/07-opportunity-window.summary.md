### Core Concept
This is the best time in 3-4 decades to learn software development—not despite AI, but because of it. Traditional barriers that kept people out for decades have fallen, and the technology adoption curve is at the ideal "Early Majority" phase.

### Key Mental Models
- **Four Fallen Gatekeepers**: Syntax memorization, debugging cryptic errors, configuration hell, and the "10,000 hours" myth—AI now handles all four
- **Expertise Amplification**: AI multiplies existing skills rather than replacing them; experienced developers see 2-3x productivity gains (vs 1.5-2x for beginners) because they know what to ask for and what to look for
- **Adoption Timing Framework**: Too early = immature tools; Too late = saturated market; Early Majority (now) = tools work + enormous growth room

### Critical Patterns
- Identify your category (beginner, experienced dev, entrepreneur, career changer) to understand your unique advantage
- Domain expertise + AI orchestration skills = ability to build production software without becoming a full-time programmer
- First movers in Early Majority capture disproportionate value: expertise, reputation, influence on best practices

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming AI diminishes developer value—it amplifies expertise by handling implementation while you focus on strategy
- Believing you need years of practice before building anything meaningful—with AI, beginners build production apps in weeks
- Waiting for a "better time"—the opportunity window is open now but won't stay open forever

- **Leads to**: Why traditional CS education is falling behind and how this book fills the gap (Lesson 8)
