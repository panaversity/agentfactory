# Part 3: Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering

You're no longer just writing code—you're directing intelligent agents like Claude Code and Gemini CLI to implement what you specify. The developers who thrive in this new era aren't those who type the fastest, but those who communicate most clearly with their AI partners. The three foundational skills — markdown formatting, prompt engineering, and context engineering — determine whether AI helps you build faster or slows you down with buggy, generic code.

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 11: Markdown: The Language of AI Communication

**What it is:** Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters. AI agents love it because it's structured and easy to read.

**Why it matters:** AI agents "think" in Markdown. When you format your specifications, documentation, and prompts using Markdown, AI understands your intent better and generates higher-quality code. Every major AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) uses Markdown as its native format. Learning Markdown isn't just about formatting—it's about speaking the AI's language.

### Chapter 12: Prompt Engineering for AI-Driven Development

**What it is:** Prompt engineering is the skill of communicating effectively with AI coding agents to get production-quality code.

**Why it matters:** Clear prompts = working code on the first try. Vague prompts = hours spent debugging AI-generated mistakes. Mastering prompting techniques is essential for effective AI collaboration.

### Chapter 16: Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development

**What it is:** Context engineering is managing what your AI agent "knows" about your project—the files, patterns, and decisions that make code fit your specific needs rather than generic tutorials.

**Why it matters:** Without good context, AI generates code that might work in isolation but breaks when integrated. With proper context management, AI maintains consistency across multiple sessions, remembers your architectural decisions, and generates code that matches your existing patterns.

**The connection:** Markdown is **the format** AI uses to structure information. Prompting is **what you SAY** to your AI agent. Context is **what your AI agent KNOWS** when you say it. Together, they form your complete AI collaboration skillset.

From here on, every chapter in this book uses AI collaboration as the default workflow. You'll write specifications in Markdown, communicate through well-crafted prompts, and manage context effectively. 

The shift starts now: from passive reader to active AI orchestrator.
