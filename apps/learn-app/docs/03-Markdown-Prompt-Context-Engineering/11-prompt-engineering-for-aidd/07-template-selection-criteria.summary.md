### Core Concept
Apply systematic decision frameworks (4 questions in 30 seconds) to determine whether to use existing template, custom prompt, or hybrid approach—preventing template forcing and time waste.

### Key Mental Models
- **Task Categories**: 5 types (Diagnostic/Transformative/Generative/Explanatory/Evaluative) map to template approaches
- **Template Assumptions**: Each template has built-in assumptions (e.g., Bug Fix assumes code exists); task must match ALL to use template
- **Time Calculation**: Use template if (fill time + adapt time) < custom prompt time
- **Hybrid Approach**: Template covers 70%+ + 1-2 custom sections = faster than pure custom
- **Decision Tree Efficiency**: 20-30 seconds to walk decision framework (Quick 1: Recurring? 2: Template exists? 3: Matches assumptions? 4: Faster to adapt?)

### Critical Patterns
- **Question 1: Recurrence Check** — Have you done this task 2+ times? (if no → custom)
- **Question 2: Template Fit** — Does template category match task type? (if no → custom)
- **Question 3: Assumption Match** — Does task satisfy ALL template's built-in assumptions? (if no → adapt or custom)
- **Question 4: Adaptation Speed** — Would customizing template be faster than writing custom prompt? (compares effort)
- **New Template Signal**: Task recurring 3+ times but no template exists → Create new template (shows pattern worthiness)

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Templates guide AI toward structured reasoning (categorization prevents vague approaches)
- Structured template sections enforce decision logic (AI uses same decision frameworks as humans)
- Template recommendations use task description to suggest best template (AI as decision assistant)
- Template evolution based on selection patterns (high-use templates get refined)

### Common Mistakes
- Template forcing (adapting task into wrong template costs more than custom)
- Always custom (ignoring templates even when fit perfectly)
- No template evolution (accepting gaps instead of improving templates based on misses)
- Slow decision-making (spending 5+ minutes deciding negates template time savings)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Reusable templates (criteria for when to use them), task categorization (5 task types)
- **Leads to**: Template library tool (operationalizes selection framework), specification-driven development (decision frameworks become code logic)
