# Slides Directory

This directory contains PDF slide decks generated from NotebookLM for each chapter.

## Naming Convention
- Format: `chapter-[NN]-slides.pdf`
- Examples:
  - `chapter-01-slides.pdf` (Chapter 1: AI Development Revolution)
  - `chapter-13-slides.pdf` (Chapter 13: Python UV)

## File Organization
Slides are stored flat in this directory (no subdirectories) to simplify paths in MDX imports.

## Workflow
See `docs/workflows/notebooklm-slides-workflow.md` for instructions on generating and embedding slides.
