## THE STORY

A castle built on sand collapses. A castle built on bedrock stands for centuries. Constitution is your bedrock—weak foundation guarantees weak everything downstream.

**Emotional Intent**: Architectural inevitability. Foundation quality determines all.

**Visual Metaphor**: Waterfall or building foundation → floors. Quality (or lack) flows downward.

**Key Insight**: Constitution is one-time investment with infinite ROI.

## CONDENSED BRIEF

Cascade diagram showing how Constitution quality flows through all downstream phases.

**Left Path - Weak Constitution**:
- Top: "Weak Constitution" (cracked foundation)
- Cascades down through: Vague Specs → Confused Plans → Messy Tasks → Buggy Code
- Visual: Cracking/degrading as it flows
- Color: Red gradient (deterioration)
- End state: "Rebuild required"

**Right Path - Strong Constitution**:
- Top: "Strong Constitution" (solid foundation)
- Cascades down through: Clear Specs → Structured Plans → Atomic Tasks → Robust Code
- Visual: Strengthening/solidifying as it flows
- Color: Blue-green gradient (compound quality)
- End state: "Scales effortlessly"

Bottom: "Foundation once, benefit forever. Choose wisely."

## COLOR SEMANTICS
- Red (#dc2626): Weak path, degradation
- Blue-green (#2563eb → #10b981): Strong path, compound quality
- Gray (#6b7280): Cascade structure

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Student grasps in <7 seconds: Foundation quality is non-negotiable. Weak = rebuild. Strong = scale.

## Alt Text
Cascade comparison: weak Constitution leads to degrading quality (vague specs, confused plans, buggy code) vs strong Constitution leads to compounding quality (clear specs, structured plans, robust code).
