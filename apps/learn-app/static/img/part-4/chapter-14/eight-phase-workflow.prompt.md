## THE STORY

New developer asks: "Where do I start?" Workflow provides map. "You are here. Next step is there. Final destination is visible."

**Emotional Intent**: Navigation confidence. Chaos → clear path → progress tracking.

**Visual Metaphor**: Journey map with checkpoints. Progress bar showing current phase.

**Key Insight**: Workflow isn't rigid—it's scaffolding. Master phases, then adapt.

## CONDENSED BRIEF

Linear eight-phase workflow diagram showing Spec-Kit Plus development journey.

**Phases (left to right, with icons)**:

1. **Constitution** → 📜 "Set project standards"
2. **Specify** → 📝 "Define feature requirements"
3. **Clarify** → 🔍 "Fill specification gaps"
4. **Plan** → 🗺️ "Architecture + decomposition"
5. **Tasks** → ✅ "Atomic work units"
6. **Implement** → 💻 "AI-driven code generation"
7. **Reusable Intelligence** → 🧠 "Extract patterns → Skills/Subagents"
8. **Orchestration** → 🎭 "Multi-agent coordination"

**Visual Elements**:
- Arrow flow connecting phases
- Progress indicator: "You are here" pointer
- Cycle arrow from phase 8 back to 1: "New feature, proven intelligence"
- Color progression: Blue (foundation) → Green (implementation) → Purple (intelligence) → Gold (orchestration)

**Bottom**: "Eight phases, clear progression. Learn once, apply everywhere."
