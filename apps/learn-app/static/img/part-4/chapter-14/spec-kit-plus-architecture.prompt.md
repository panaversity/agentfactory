## THE STORY

Spec-Kit Plus isn't a linear tool—it's two-dimensional intelligence. Vertical: orchestrator + specialists. Horizontal: decisions + history. Both dimensions compound over time.

**Emotional Intent**: Architectural elegance. "Oh, that's clever—it scales both ways."

**Visual Metaphor**: Two-axis coordinate system. X-axis = time/reuse. Y-axis = complexity/orchestration.

**Key Insight**: Intelligence accumulates horizontally (ADRs/PHRs) AND vertically (skills/subagents).

## CONDENSED BRIEF

Two-dimensional architecture diagram showing Spec-Kit Plus intelligence axes.

**Horizontal Axis (Bottom) - "Institutional Memory"**:
- Label: "Horizontal Intelligence → Reuse Across Projects"
- Components flowing left-to-right:
  - Constitution (project standards)
  - ADRs (architecture decisions recorded)
  - PHRs (prompt history patterns)
  - Memory Files (persistent context)
- Visual: Timeline arrow, documents accumulating
- Color: Blue (#2563eb)
- Benefit: "Every project teaches next project"

**Vertical Axis (Left) - "Orchestration Scale"**:
- Label: "Vertical Intelligence → Team Coordination"
- Components flowing bottom-to-top:
  - Skills (2-4 decisions, guidance)
  - Subagents (5+ decisions, autonomous)
  - Orchestrator (coordinates multiple agents)
  - Multi-Agent Teams (5-7 specialists)
- Visual: Hierarchy pyramid, increasing coordination
- Color: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Benefit: "From solo dev to team lead"

**Center Intersection - "Spec-Kit Plus"**:
- Both dimensions meet
- Label: "Compound Intelligence"
- Shows: Reusable knowledge (horizontal) × Team scale (vertical) = Exponential capability
- Visual: Glowing center point, expansion arrows

**Bottom Annotation**: "Two dimensions, one goal: Intelligence that compounds."

## COLOR SEMANTICS
- Blue (#2563eb): Horizontal axis (memory, reuse)
- Purple (#8b5cf6): Vertical axis (orchestration, scale)
- Green (#10b981): Center intersection (compound effect)
- Gray (#6b7280): Structure, labels

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Student grasps in <12 seconds: Spec-Kit Plus scales two ways—reuse across projects (horizontal) + team coordination (vertical). Both compound.
