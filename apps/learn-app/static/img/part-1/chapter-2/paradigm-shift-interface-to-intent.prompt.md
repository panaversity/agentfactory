## Final Successful Prompt

```
Create a clean split-screen comparison diagram showing the paradigm shift from User Interface to User Intent.

White background, 16:9 aspect ratio.

LEFT SIDE - "Old Paradigm: User Interface" (light gray background):
- Vertical flow with 3 boxes and arrows:
Box 1: "User"
↓
Box 2: "Interface"
↓
Box 3: "Action"

Below flow, 3 bullet points:
• Users navigate explicit interfaces
• Every action needs manual initiation
• Interface is the bottleneck

CENTER: Large orange arrow pointing right with text "SHIFT"

RIGHT SIDE - "New Paradigm: User Intent" (light orange background):
- Horizontal flow with 3 boxes and arrows:
Box 1: "User Intent" → Box 2: "Agent" → Box 3: "Orchestrated Actions"

Below flow, 3 bullet points:
• Users state intent conversationally
• AI agents act AUTONOMOUSLY
• Conversation replaces navigation

IMPORTANT: Spell "autonomously" correctly - A-U-T-O-N-O-M-O-U-S-L-Y

Clean, modern, professional design with simple flow diagrams.

## Generation Notes

**Attempts Log**:
- **Attempt 1**: Spelling error - "autonomouss" instead of "autonomously"
- **Attempt 2**: Added letter-by-letter spelling instruction → SUCCESS ✓

**Issues Encountered**:
- Spelling: "autonomous" consistently misspelled as "autonomouss" without explicit guidance

**Solutions Applied**:
- Letter-by-letter spelling with IMPORTANT prefix: "A-U-T-O-N-O-M-O-U-S-L-Y"
- This eliminated the spelling error completely

**Key Success Factors**:
- **Letter-by-letter spelling strategy** (PRIMARY): Proactively identified "autonomous" as high-risk word (4 syllables, technical)
- **Split-screen layout**: Clean separation between old and new paradigms
- **Directional flow difference**: Vertical (constrained) vs Horizontal (fluid) reinforces paradigm shift
- **Color psychology**: Gray (past) vs Orange (present/forward)
- **Minimal text**: 3 bullet points per side keeps cognitive load low

**Reusable Patterns**:
- Letter-by-letter spelling for multi-syllable words (4+ syllables)
- Split-screen comparison with central transformation arrow
- Vertical vs horizontal flow to show paradigm shift
- Color tinting to differentiate old vs new

## Image Metadata

**Alt Text**: Split-screen comparison diagram showing the shift from User Interface paradigm (vertical flow: User → Interface → Action) to User Intent paradigm (horizontal flow: User Intent → Agent → Orchestrated Actions) with central orange "SHIFT" arrow.

**Pedagogical Value**:
- **Teaches**: The fundamental transformation from interface-bound interaction (manual, constrained) to intent-driven orchestration (conversational, autonomous)
- **Message**: "AI shifts development from navigating interfaces to stating intent—agents orchestrate automatically"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 18 (Three-Role AI Partnership) - Shows AI agent as autonomous collaborator, not passive tool
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Abstract paradigm shift becomes concrete visual model with clear before/after flows

**Design Specs**:
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **Dimensions**: ~1792x1024px (Gemini default for 16:9)
- **Color Palette**: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for old paradigm, Light orange (#FFF4E6) for new paradigm, Orange (#FF6B35) for SHIFT arrow
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (likely Roboto or Arial), Bold for headings, Regular for body text
- **Layout**: 50/50 split with 10% center buffer for transformation arrow
