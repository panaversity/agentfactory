## Corrected Prompt (Minimal Text)

```
Create a professional statistics dashboard showing AI capability breakthroughs from 2025.

16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px), light gray background (#F8F9FA).

Title at top (centered):
"AI Capability Breakthroughs 2025"
Subtitle: "Competitive Programming Results"

2x2 grid of large metric cards below title.

Each card: White background, rounded corners, subtle shadow, minimal text.

CARD 1 (top-left, Orange accent):
Large number: "12/12"
Label below: "Perfect Score"
Small text: "OpenAI ICPC Finals"

CARD 2 (top-right, Blue accent):
Large number: "10/12"
Label below: "Gold Medal"
Small text: "Gemini 2.5 Deep Think"

CARD 3 (bottom-left, Teal accent):
Large number: "49%"
Label below: "Win Rate"
Small text: "Claude Opus 4.1 GDPval"

CARD 4 (bottom-right, Orange accent):
Large number: "40.6%"
Label below: "Win Rate"
Small text: "GPT-5 GDPval"

Typography:
- Title: 52pt bold, dark gray
- Numbers: 84pt bold (LARGEST element)
- Labels: 20pt medium, dark gray
- Small text: 14pt regular, medium gray

CRITICAL:
- Numbers must be BIGGEST text on card
- Minimal text - only what's shown above
- No additional descriptions
- Clean, spacious layout
```

## Key Changes from Original

1. **Reduced text by 60%** - removed all detailed descriptions
2. **Larger numbers** - 84pt (was smaller/unclear)
3. **Simplified labels** - "OpenAI ICPC Finals" instead of "OpenAI at ICPC World Finals - all problems solved"
4. **Better visual hierarchy** - numbers dominate, text minimal
5. **Cleaner layout** - more whitespace, easier scanning
