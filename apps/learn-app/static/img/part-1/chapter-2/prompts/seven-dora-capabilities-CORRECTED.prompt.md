## Corrected Prompt (Minimal Text, Fixed Descriptions)

```
Create a professional grid showing the 7 DORA capabilities for AI success.

16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px), light gray background (#F8F9FA).

Title at top (centered):
"Seven DORA Capabilities for AI Success"

7 cards in asymmetric grid:
- Top row: 3 cards (wider)
- Bottom row: 4 cards (narrower)

Each card: Number badge, icon, name, ONE short line of text only.

CARD 1 (Orange):
Number: "1"
Icon: Document with checkmark
Name: "Clear AI Stance"
Text: "Documented policies"

CARD 2 (Blue):
Number: "2"
Icon: Database
Name: "Healthy Data Ecosystem"
Text: "Known sources, schemas"

CARD 3 (Teal):
Number: "3"
Icon: Folder
Name: "AI-Accessible Data"
Text: "Updated docs, examples"

CARD 4 (Orange):
Number: "4"
Icon: Git branches
Name: "Strong Version Control"
Text: "Git, PRs, history"

CARD 5 (Blue):
Number: "5"
Icon: Package/box
Name: "Small Batches"
Text: "Frequent small changes"

CARD 6 (Teal):
Number: "6"

Name: "User-Centric Focus"
Text: "Real user needs"

CARD 7 (Orange):
Number: "7"
Icon: Tools/settings
Name: "Quality Platform"
Text: "Reliable dev tools"

CRITICAL:
- Card 5 text: "Frequent small changes" (NOT "Frequent sources, schemas")
- ONLY one short line of text per card
- NO additional descriptions
- NO "Why it matters" text

Typography:
- Title: 48pt bold
- Numbers: 56pt bold in circle badge
- Names: 20pt bold, dark gray
- Text: 14pt regular, medium gray

Layout:
- Clean, spacious cards
- White background per card
- 4px top border in accent color
- Icons 24-28px
- Plenty of padding
```

## Key Changes from Original

1. **Fixed Card 5**: "Frequent small changes" (was "Frequent sources, schemas" - WRONG)
2. **Reduced text by 90%**: One short line per card (vs paragraphs)
3. **Removed "Why it matters"**: Too much text
4. **Larger numbers**: 56pt for visual hierarchy
5. **Simplified names**: "Small Batches" not "Working in Small Batches"
6. **Cleaner layout**: More whitespace, easier scanning
