## Corrected Prompt (Minimal Text)

```
Create a clean comparison table showing AI development transformation from 2024 to 2025.

16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px), white background.

Title at top (centered):
"The Evidence Compared: 2024 vs 2025"

Two-column table with 5 rows below title:
- Column headers: "2024" (left, light gray background) | "2025" (right, light orange background)
- Central vertical divider: 4px orange line
- Row labels on far left (no background)

ROW 1 - Capability:
2024: "Code completion"
2025: "Problem-solving"

ROW 2 - Adoption:
2024: "40-50% experimenting"
2025: "84% using, 51% daily"

ROW 3 - Enterprise:
2024: "Pilot projects"
2025: "Billion-dollar acquisitions"

ROW 4 - Workflow:
2024: "Occasional boost"
2025: "2 hours/day median"

ROW 5 - Developer Role:

2025: "Orchestrator directing AI"

CRITICAL SPELLING:
- O-R-C-H-E-S-T-R-A-T-O-R (not "Orchetrator")

Typography:
- Title: 48pt bold, dark gray
- Column headers: 32pt bold
- Row labels: 18pt medium, dark gray
- Cell text: 16pt regular (READABLE SIZE)
- More whitespace between rows

Layout:
- Each row: minimum 140px height for readability
- 48px padding in cells
- Remove ALL extra decorative text
- Only show what's listed above
```
