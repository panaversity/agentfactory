5 equal-width cards in a row below title.

CRITICAL SPELLING (letter by letter):
- S-E-E (NOT "Read")
- H-E-A-R
- R-E-A-S-O-N (NOT "Write")
- A-C-T (NOT "Run")
- R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R (NOT "Orchestrate")

Typography:
- Title: 48pt bold, dark gray
- Main text (power names): 28pt bold (LARGEST on card)
- Subtitles: 16pt regular, medium gray
- NO additional description text

Layout:
- Each card: ~320px width, white background, rounded corners
- 4px top border in accent color
- 40px internal padding
- Icons: 32-36px
- Clean, spacious, minimal

NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use: Read, Write, Run, Orchestrate as power names
- Do NOT add descriptions beyond subtitle
- Do NOT add extra text
```

## Key Changes from Original

1. **Correct framework**: See/Hear/Reason/Act/Remember (NOT Read/Write/Run/Hear/Orchestrate)
2. **Removed descriptions**: Only icon + name + short subtitle
3. **Larger power names**: 28pt (main focus of each card)
4. **No clutter**: Zero extra text beyond what's specified
5. **Letter-by-letter spelling**: Prevents AI generation errors
