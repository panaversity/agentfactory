## Corrected Prompt (Minimal Text, Clear Timeline)

```
Create a horizontal dual-timeline comparison showing vibe coding vs spec-driven development patterns.

16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px), white background.

Title at top (centered):
"Development Pattern Comparison"

TOP TIMELINE (light red #FFF5F5):
Label: "Team A: Vibe Coding"

Simple horizontal flow with 4 milestones:
Day 1: "Start coding"
Day 2: "Ship (crashes)"
Day 3: "Architecture resists"
Day 7: "Rebuild from scratch"

End result (red badge): "34 hours total + friction"

BOTTOM TIMELINE (light green #F5FFF5):
Label: "Team B: Spec-Driven"

Simple horizontal flow with 4 milestones:
Day 1: "Write spec"
Day 2: "Write tests + implement"
Day 5: "Ship reliably"
Day 6: "Add Word support easily"

End result (green badge): "12 hours total + sustainable"

Typography:
- Title: 48pt bold
- Team labels: 28pt bold
- Milestone text: 16pt regular (READABLE)
- Result badges: 18pt bold

Layout:
- Clean horizontal arrows between milestones
- Warning icons (⚠) for Team A problems
- Success icons (✓) for Team B wins
- Minimal text - only what's shown above
- Large spacing between milestones

IMPORTANT:
- Use simple day labels (Day 1, 2, 3, etc.) not complex descriptions
- Keep milestone text to 2-3 words maximum
- Focus on visual flow, not text details
```

## Key Changes from Original

1. **Reduced text by 80%**: Milestone text now 2-3 words max
2. **Clearer day labels**: "Day 1" instead of complex timeline stamps
3. **Larger text**: 16pt minimum for readability
4. **Simplified milestones**: Key moments only (4 per timeline, not 5-6)
5. **Visual icons**: ⚠ and ✓ for quick scanning
6. **Focus on outcome**: Result badges are prominent
