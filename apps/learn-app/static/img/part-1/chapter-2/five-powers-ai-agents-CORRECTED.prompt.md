## Corrected Prompt

```
Create a professional diagram titled "The Five Powers of AI Agents" with 5 cards arranged horizontally.

White or light gray background (#F8F9FA), 16:9 aspect ratio (1792x1024px).

Title centered at top: "The Five Powers of AI Agents"
Subtitle centered below title: "Capabilities Enabling Autonomous Orchestration"

Five cards with rounded corners (12px radius), white background, subtle shadows, each containing:

1. SEE card (Blue #0066FF icon and accent):
   - Icon: Eye or vision symbol (32-40px)
   - Main text: "See"
   - Subtitle: "Visual Understanding"
   - Description: "Process images, screenshots, navigate interfaces"

2. HEAR card (Purple #8B5CF6 icon and accent):
   - Icon: Ear or audio waves (32-40px)
   - Main text: "Hear"
   - Subtitle: "Audio Processing"
   - Description: "Voice interfaces, transcription, sentiment"

3. REASON card (Orange #FF6B35 icon and accent):
   - Icon: Brain or thinking symbol (32-40px)
   - Main text: "Reason"
   - Subtitle: "Complex Decision-Making"
   - Description: "Analyze tradeoffs, chain reasoning"

4. ACT card (Teal #00B4D8 icon and accent):
   - Icon: Lightning bolt or action symbol (32-40px)
   - Main text: "Act"
   - Subtitle: "Execute & Orchestrate"
   - Description: "Call APIs, perform actions, coordinate"

5. REMEMBER card (Green #10B981 icon and accent):
   - Icon: Database or memory symbol (32-40px)
   - Main text: "Remember"
   - Subtitle: "Maintain Context"
   - Description: "Store preferences, recall, adapt"

CRITICAL SPELLING REQUIREMENTS:
- Card 1: S-E-E (not "Read")
- Card 2: H-E-A-R
- Card 3: R-E-A-S-O-N (not "Write")
- Card 4: A-C-T (not "Run")
- Card 5: R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R (not "Orchestrate")

IMPORTANT NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use "Read" - use "See"
- Do NOT use "Write" - use "Reason"
- Do NOT use "Run" - use "Act"
- Do NOT use "Orchestrate" as a power name - use "Remember"
- Do NOT add extra text beyond what's specified
- Do NOT mix coding-specific terms (code, docs, APIs) - keep general

Modern, clean design with:
- Consistent spacing between cards (32-40px gaps)
- 4px top border on each card in accent color
- Card dimensions: ~320px width x 240px height
- 56px margins from edges
- Sans-serif typography (Roboto Bold for titles, Roboto Regular for descriptions)
- Title: 48-52pt, Dark Gray (#1A1A1A)
- Subtitle: 18-20pt, Medium Gray (#666666)
- Card main text: 28-32pt, Dark Gray (#1A1A1A)
- Card subtitles: 16-18pt, Medium Gray (#666666)
- Card descriptions: 14pt, Light Gray (#999999)
```

## Generation Notes

**Why This Image Needs Correction**:

The current `five-powers-ai-agents.png` was generated with the wrong conceptual framework. It shows:
- Read, Write, Run, Hear, Orchestrate (AI Coding Agent capabilities)

But the lesson explicitly teaches a different framework:
- See, Hear, Reason, Act, Remember (General Agentic AI powers)

**Lesson Context** (lines 219-308):

The lesson explains that agentic AI can orchestrate workflows because it possesses **five fundamental capabilities**:

1. **👁️ See** — Visual Understanding
   - Process images, screenshots, documents, videos
   - Extract meaning from visual context
   - Navigate interfaces by "seeing" them
   - Example: Claude Code reading error screenshots to debug issues

2. **👂 Hear** — Audio Processing
   - Understand spoken requests (voice interfaces)
   - Transcribe and analyze conversations
   - Detect sentiment and tone
   - Example: Voice assistants understanding natural speech

3. **🧠 Reason** — Complex Decision-Making
   - Analyze tradeoffs and constraints
   - Make context-aware decisions
   - Chain multi-step reasoning (if X, then Y, then Z)
   - Example: Agent choosing optimal hotel based on price, location, preferences

4. **⚡ Act** — Execute and Orchestrate
   - Call APIs and use tools autonomously
   - Perform actions across multiple systems
   - Coordinate complex workflows
   - Example: Claude Code writing files, running tests, committing to Git

5. **💾 Remember** — Maintain Context and Learn
   - Store user preferences and history
   - Recall previous interactions
   - Build domain knowledge over time
   - Example: Agent remembering you prefer quiet hotel rooms

**Pedagogical Message**:

The lesson teaches that these five powers **combine** to enable autonomous orchestration (lines 291-308):

> "**Individually**, each power is useful but limited. **Combined**, they create something transformational: **autonomous orchestration**."

The hotel booking example (lines 298-307) demonstrates all 5 powers working together in sequence: Hear → Reason → Remember → Act → See → Reason → Act → Remember.

**Current Image Problem**:

The existing image uses a *different* framework focused on coding-specific capabilities:
- "Read" (code, docs, APIs) - specific to development context
- "Write" (generate, refactor) - specific to code generation
- "Run" (execute, test, debug) - specific to code execution
- "Hear" (voice commands) - ✅ matches
- "Orchestrate" (multi-step workflows) - this is the *outcome* of combining all 5 powers, not a power itself

This creates confusion because:
1. Students read about "See, Hear, Reason, Act, Remember" in the text
2. Students see "Read, Write, Run, Hear, Orchestrate" in the image
3. Only "Hear" matches - 4 out of 5 powers are different
4. "Orchestrate" is presented as a power when the lesson says it's the *result* of combining powers

## Expected Success Criteria

✅ All 5 power names match lesson exactly: See, Hear, Reason, Act, Remember
✅ Icons appropriate for general agentic capabilities (not coding-specific)
✅ Descriptions align with lesson text (lines 221-288)
✅ Visual hierarchy clear: title → 5 equal-importance cards
✅ Color variety for visual distinction
✅ Professional, publication-ready quality
✅ No spelling errors
✅ No extra/decorative text beyond specification

---

## Reusable Patterns

**From Previous Success (paradigm-shift, original five-powers)**:
- Letter-by-letter spelling for critical terms prevents errors
- Negative instructions prevent unwanted additions
- Horizontal card layout for equal-importance concepts (5 cards max)
- Icon + primary label + subtitle + description pattern
- Alternating colors for visual rhythm

**New Requirements for This Image**:
- General agentic capabilities (not coding-specific)
- Emphasize these are *fundamental capabilities* that combine
- Visual should support lesson's narrative: powers → orchestration outcome

## Image Metadata

**Alt Text**: Diagram showing the five fundamental powers of AI agents: See (visual understanding), Hear (audio processing), Reason (complex decision-making), Act (execute and orchestrate), and Remember (maintain context), arranged as horizontal cards with distinctive colored icons.

**Pedagogical Value**:
- **Teaches**: The five fundamental capabilities that enable AI agents to function as autonomous partners (not just tools)
- **Message**: "AI agents combine five powers—seeing, hearing, reasoning, acting, and remembering—to orchestrate complex workflows autonomously"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 18 (Three-Role AI Partnership) - Shows AI agent capabilities enabling co-worker role
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Five sequential text sections unified into scannable framework showing how powers combine

**Design Specs**:
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **Dimensions**: 1792x1024px (Gemini/DALL-E standard for 16:9)

  - Purple #8B5CF6 (Hear)
  - Orange #FF6B35 (Reason)
  - Teal #00B4D8 (Act)
  - Green #10B981 (Remember)
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (Roboto preferred), Bold for card titles, Regular for descriptions
- **Layout**: 5 equal-width cards (~320px each) with consistent 32-40px spacing
- **Icons**: Simple line art, 32-40px, matching card accent colors
- **Card specs**:
  - Rounded corners (12px radius)
  - Subtle shadow (0px 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08))
  - White background (#FFFFFF)
  - 4px top border in accent color
  - 40px internal padding
