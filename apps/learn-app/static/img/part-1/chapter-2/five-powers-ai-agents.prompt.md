## Final Successful Prompt

```
Create a professional diagram titled "The Five Powers of AI Coding Agents" with 5 cards arranged horizontally.

White background, 16:9 aspect ratio.

Title centered at top: "The Five Powers of AI Coding Agents"

Five cards with rounded corners, each containing:
1. READ card (blue icon):
   - Icon: Open book or document
   - Text: "Read"
   - Subtitle: "Code, docs, APIs"

2. WRITE card (green icon):
   - Icon: Pencil or edit symbol
   - Text: "Write"
   - Subtitle: "Generate, refactor"

3. RUN card (orange icon):
   - Icon: Terminal or play button
   - Text: "Run"
   - Subtitle: "Execute, test, debug"

4. HEAR card (purple icon):
   - Icon: Ear or audio waves
   - Text: "Hear"
   - Subtitle: "Voice commands"

5. ORCHESTRATE card (red icon):
   - Icon: Network or connection nodes
   - Text: "Orchestrate"
   - Subtitle: "Multi-step workflows"

IMPORTANT:
- Spell "Orchestrate" correctly: O-R-C-H-E-S-T-R-A-T-E
- Card 4 should ONLY say "Hear" as the main text, with "Voice commands" as subtitle
- Do NOT add any extra text like "Audio" to the Hear card

Modern, clean design with consistent spacing between cards.
```

## Generation Notes

**Attempts Log**:
- **Attempt 1**: Two issues - (1) Spelling error: "Orchterrate" instead of "Orchestrate", (2) Redundant text: "Hear | Audio" instead of just "Hear"
- **Attempt 2**: Added letter-by-letter spelling + negative instruction → SUCCESS ✓

**Issues Encountered**:
- Spelling: "Orchestrate" misspelled as "Orchterrate" (uncommon word, 4 syllables)
- Redundant text: Gemini added "Audio" label to "Hear" card unnecessarily

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Letter-by-letter spelling**: "O-R-C-H-E-S-T-R-A-T-E" (eliminated spelling error)
2. **Negative instruction**: "Card 4 should ONLY say 'Hear'... Do NOT add any extra text like 'Audio'" (eliminated redundant text)

**Key Success Factors**:
- **Letter-by-letter spelling strategy**: Proactively identified "Orchestrate" as high-risk (4 syllables, technical term)
- **Negative instruction strategy**: Explicitly prevented unwanted decorative text
- **Horizontal card layout**: Simple, scannable, equal visual weight
- **Icon + Text + Subtitle structure**: Consistent pattern across all 5 cards
- **Color variety**: Different colors for visual distinction between powers

**Reusable Patterns**:
- Letter-by-letter spelling for technical terms (4+ syllables)
- Negative instructions to prevent Gemini from adding decorative text
- Horizontal card grid for equal-importance concepts (5 cards max)
- Icon + primary label + subtitle pattern for concept cards
- Alternating colors for visual rhythm without overwhelming

## Image Metadata

**Alt Text**: Diagram showing the five powers of AI coding agents as horizontal cards: Read (code, docs, APIs), Write (generate, refactor), Run (execute, test, debug), Hear (voice commands), and Orchestrate (multi-step workflows), each with distinctive colored icons.

**Pedagogical Value**:
- **Teaches**: The five fundamental capabilities that enable AI agents to function as autonomous development partners (not just code completion tools)
- **Message**: "AI coding agents combine five powers—reading, writing, executing, listening, and orchestrating—to act as full development partners"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 18 (Three-Role AI Partnership) - Shows AI agent capabilities that enable co-worker role, not just assistant
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Five sequential text sections unified into scannable framework showing equal-importance powers

**Design Specs**:
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **Dimensions**: ~1792x1024px (Gemini default for 16:9)
- **Color Palette**: Blue (Read), Green (Write), Orange (Run), Purple (Hear), Red (Orchestrate)
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (likely Roboto or Arial), Bold for card titles, Regular for subtitles
- **Layout**: 5 equal-width cards arranged horizontally with consistent spacing
- **Icons**: Simple line art style, ~40-48px, matching card colors
- **Card specs**: Rounded corners (~8-12px radius), subtle shadow for depth, white background
