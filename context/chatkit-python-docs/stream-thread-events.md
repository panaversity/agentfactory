# Stream responses back to your user

ChatKit.js listens for `ThreadStreamEvent`s over SSE. Stream events from `ChatKitServer.respond` so users see model output, tool activity, progress updates, and errors in real time.

Thread events include both persistent thread items (messages, tools, workflows) that are saved to the conversation history, and non-persistent runtime signals (progress updates, notices, errors, and client effects) that show ephemeral UI or drive immediate client behavior without being stored.

### From `respond`

`stream_agent_response` converts a streamed Agents SDK run into ChatKit events. Yield those events directly from `respond`, or yield any `ThreadStreamEvent` yourself—the server processes them the same way.

Example using `stream_agent_response` with a run result:

```python
class MyChatKitServer(ChatKitServer[MyRequestContext]):
    async def respond(...) -> AsyncIterator[ThreadStreamEvent]:
        # Build model inputs and agent context as shown in previous guides.

        result = Runner.run_streamed(...)
        async for event in stream_agent_response(agent_context, result):
            yield event
```

### From tools

Server tools enqueue events with the `AgentContext` helpers; `stream_agent_response` drains and forwards them.

Example emitting an ephemeral progress update event during a tool call:

```python
@function_tool()
async def long_running_tool(ctx: RunContextWrapper[AgentContext]):
    await ctx.context.stream(ProgressUpdateEvent(text="Working..."))

    # Tool logic omitted for brevity
```

### Handle guardrail triggers

Guardrail tripwires raise `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` or `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` once partial assistant output has been rolled back. Catch them around `stream_agent_response` and optionally send a user-facing event so the client knows why the turn stopped.

```python
from agents import InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered, OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered
from chatkit.types import ErrorEvent

try:
    async for event in stream_agent_response(agent_context, result):
        yield event
except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
    yield ErrorEvent(message="We blocked that message for safety.")
except OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
    yield ErrorEvent(
        message="The assistant response was blocked.",
        allow_retry=False,
    )
```

## Stream events without `stream_agent_response`

You can bypass the Agents SDK helper and yield `ThreadStreamEvent`s directly from `respond`. ChatKitServer will persist and route them the same way.

```python
class MyChatKitServer(ChatKitServer[MyRequestContext]):
    async def respond(...) -> AsyncIterator[ThreadStreamEvent]:
        # Example transient progress update
        yield ProgressUpdateEvent(
            icon="search",
            text="Searching..."
        )

        # Run your inference pipeline here
        output = await run_inference(thread, input, context)

        # Stream a persisted assistant message
        yield ThreadItemDoneEvent(
            item=AssistantMessageItem(
                thread_id=thread.id,
                id=self.store.generate_item_id("message", thread, context),
                created_at=datetime.now(),
                content=[AssistantMessageContent(text=output)],
            )
        )
```

When you stream thread events manually, remember that tools cannot `yield` events. If you skip `stream_agent_response`, you must merge any tool-emitted events yourself—for example, by reading from `AgentContext._events` (populated by `ctx.context.stream(...)` or workflow helpers) and interleaving them with your own `respond` events.

## Event types at a glance

Use these when emitting events directly (or alongside `stream_agent_response`). Thread lifecycle events become part of conversation history; the others are ephemeral runtime signals that shape client behavior but are not persisted.

### Thread lifecycle events

Thread item events drive the conversation state. ChatKitServer processes these events to persist conversation state before streaming them back to the client.

- `ThreadItemAddedEvent`: introduce a new item (message, tool call, workflow, widget, etc).
- `ThreadItemUpdatedEvent`: mutate a pending item (e.g., stream text deltas, workflow task updates).
- `ThreadItemDoneEvent`: mark an item complete and persist it.
- `ThreadItemRemovedEvent`: delete an item by id.
- `ThreadItemReplacedEvent`: swap an item in place.

Note: `ThreadItemAddedEvent` does not persist the item. `ChatKitServer` saves on `ThreadItemDoneEvent`/`ThreadItemReplacedEvent`, tracks pending items in between, and handles store writes for all `ThreadItem*Event`s.

### Errors

Stream an `ErrorEvent` for user-facing errors.

```python
async def respond(...) -> AsyncIterator[ThreadStreamEvent]:
    if not user_has_remaining_quota(context):
        yield ErrorEvent(
            message="You have reached your usage limit.",
            allow_retry=False,
        )
        return

    # Rest of your respond method
```

### Progress updates

Stream `ProgressUpdateEvent` to show the user transient status while work is in flight.

See [Show progress for long-running tools](add-features/show-progress-for-long-running-tools.md) for more info.

### Client effects

Use `ClientEffectEvent` to trigger fire-and-forget behavior on the client such as opening a dialog or pushing updates.

See [Send client effects](add-features/send-client-effects.md) for more info.

### Stream options

`StreamOptionsEvent` configures runtime stream behavior (for example, allowing user cancellation). `ChatKitServer` emits one at the start of every stream using `get_stream_options`; override that method to change defaults such as `allow_cancel`.
