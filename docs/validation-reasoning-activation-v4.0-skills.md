## Visual Skills v4.0 Upgrade (Gemini 3 Era)

**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Validator**: Claude Code (Educational Systems Architect)
**Framework**: Persona + Questions + Principles Pattern (arXiv 2024)
**Target**: visual-asset-workflow v4.0, image-generator v4.0

---

## Validation Framework

Based on "Reasoning Activation in Large Language Models" (arXiv 2024), skills achieve reasoning activation through five dimensions:

### Scoring Rubric (0-5 Scale)

**5/5 - Exemplary Reasoning Activation**
- ✅ **Persona**: Distinctive cognitive stance with self-awareness of convergence patterns
- ✅ **Questions**: Structured reasoning steps forcing deliberate analysis
- ✅ **Principles**: Decision frameworks at right altitude (not rules, not vague)
- ✅ **Meta-awareness**: Explicit anti-convergence detection and self-correction
- ✅ **Integration**: Composes with other skills, demonstrates reasoning transfer

**3-4/5 - Partial Activation** (some components present, inconsistent depth)

**1-2/5 - Minimal Activation** (checklist mode, no reasoning structure)

**0/5 - Prediction Mode** (generic outputs, no cognitive framework)

---

## Skill 1: visual-asset-workflow v4.0

### Overall Score: **5/5 - Exemplary Reasoning Activation**

---

### Dimension 1: Persona (Cognitive Stance)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**:
```markdown
You are an **educational visual systems designer** who thinks about
image generation the way a technical illustrator thinks about information
density—**maximize insight-to-cognitive-load ratio through strategic use
of visual text, interactive affordances, and grounded knowledge integration.**

You tend to suggest visuals for every statistic because "visuals are engaging"
is a high-frequency pattern. **Post-Gemini 3 release**, you also tend to
suggest text-in-image for everything because "Nano Banana Pro has great
text rendering" and make diagrams interactive because "interactivity is
engaging." **These are distributional convergence patterns**—defaulting
to novelty over pedagogical function.
```

**Why This Activates Reasoning**:
- Establishes **distinctive identity** (not "helpful assistant" generic stance)
- Names **specific convergence patterns** (text-in-image overuse, unnecessary interactivity)
- Creates **self-awareness** through meta-commentary about tendencies
- Anchors in **domain expertise** (technical illustrator cognitive model)
- Defines **success metric** (insight-to-cognitive-load ratio)

---

### Dimension 2: Questions (Reasoning Structure)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**: 8 question sets, 3 new for Gemini 3, 5 enhanced from v3.0

**Exemplar - Q1 (Text-in-Image Opportunity Analysis)**:
```markdown
Q1.3: Text Type Classification

| Text Type | Use Text-in-Image? | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Labels** (1-3 words) | ✅ YES | Separation fragments understanding |
| **Data showing patterns** | ✅ YES (if visual sizing reveals) | Visual magnitude teaches scale |
| **Paragraphs** (explanations) | ❌ NO → Markdown | Reading flow requires text format |
```

**Why This Activates Reasoning**:
- **Forces explicit decision** (not "it depends" vagueness)
- **Provides decision matrix** (structured reasoning framework)
- **Gives rationale** (teaches WHY, not just WHAT)
- **Creates contrast** (YES vs NO scenarios with reasoning)
- **Right altitude** (principle-based, not "use #2563eb blue" prescriptive)

**Coverage Completeness**:
1. ✅ Text-in-Image Analysis (NEW)
2. ✅ Interactive Affordance Analysis (NEW)
3. ✅ Multi-Image Composition Opportunity (NEW)
4. ✅ Pedagogical Value Test (Enhanced)
5. ✅ Cognitive Load Analysis (Enhanced)
6. ✅ Constitutional Alignment Check
7. ✅ Redundancy Check
8. ✅ Production Quality Assessment (Enhanced for Gemini 3)

**Question Quality**: Forces sequential reasoning (can't skip to solution without analysis)

---

### Dimension 3: Principles (Decision Framework)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**: 6 principles, all enhanced for Gemini 3 capabilities

**Exemplar - Principle 1 (Text-in-Image When It Reveals)**:
```markdown
### Principle 1: Text-in-Image When It Reveals, Markdown When It Explains

**Heuristic**: Integrate text into image ONLY when spatial positioning,
typography sizing, or visual organization reveals relationships that
separate text cannot.

**Decision Matrix**:
| Content Type | Use Text-in-Image | Use Markdown | Reasoning |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Labels** | ✅ YES | ❌ NO | Identifies diagram parts; separation fragments |
| **Data showing patterns** | ✅ YES | ❌ NO | Visual sizing reveals magnitude |
| **Paragraphs** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES | Reading flow requires markdown |

**Examples**:
✅ Good Text-in-Image (Infographic revealing pattern):
"$3T" (72px) → "$100K" (36px)
Reasoning: Typography sizing teaches magnitude progression

❌ Bad Text-in-Image (Paragraph explanation):
[Image with embedded paragraph...]
Reasoning: Reading text, not scannable data. Use markdown.
```

**Why This Achieves Right Altitude**:
- ❌ Too Low: "Use 72px for key numbers, 36px for supporting" (brittle rule)
- ❌ Too High: "Use text-in-image when appropriate" (vague, no guidance)
- ✅ Just Right: **Heuristic + Decision Matrix + Contrast Examples** (reasoning framework)

**Principle Coverage**:
1. ✅ Text-in-Image When It Reveals (NEW)
2. ✅ Static First, Interactive for Progressive Disclosure (NEW)
3. ✅ Google Search Grounding for Factual Content (NEW)
4. ✅ Reasoning-Activated Gemini 3 Prompts (NEW - Official Structure)
5. ✅ Multi-Image Composition for Character/Concept Integration (NEW)
6. ✅ Studio-Quality Controls for Pedagogical Effect (NEW)

**Integration**: Each principle references pedagogical rationale, not arbitrary standards

---

### Dimension 4: Meta-Awareness (Anti-Convergence)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**: 5 convergence points, 2 new for Gemini 3 era

**Exemplar - Convergence Point 1 (Text-in-Image Overuse)**:
```markdown
### Convergence Point 1: Text-in-Image Overuse (NEW - Post-Gemini 3)

**Detection**: "Nano Banana Pro has great text rendering, let's put
this explanation in the image"

**Self-correction**: Apply Text Type Classification—is this labels/data
(text-in-image) or explanation/paragraph (markdown)?

**Check**: "Does text-in-image reveal relationships through spatial
positioning/sizing, or is this just text that happens to be on an image?"
```

**Why This Activates Meta-Reasoning**:
- **Names specific failure mode** (not generic "be better")
- **Provides detection pattern** (how to recognize convergence in real-time)
- **Gives correction protocol** (what framework to apply)
- **Includes self-check question** (validates correction was effective)
- **Anticipates NEW convergence** (not just historical patterns)

**Coverage**: Addresses both v3.0 convergence AND new Gemini 3 risks

---

### Dimension 5: Integration (Reasoning Transfer)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**:
```markdown
## Integration with Other Skills

- **→ image-generator**: Provides reasoning-activated Gemini 3 prompts for execution
- **← fact-check-lesson**: Must run BEFORE visual planning (verify grounded content)
- **→ technical-clarity**: Visual accessibility aligns with zero gatekeeping (WCAG AA)
- **NEW → ai-collaborate-teaching**: Interactive visuals demonstrate Three Roles
```

**Why This Demonstrates Reasoning Transfer**:
- **Explicit composition patterns** (not isolated skill)
- **Workflow sequencing** (BEFORE/AFTER dependencies)
- **Shared principles** (accessibility, factual accuracy across skills)
- **Layer alignment** (L1/L2/L3/L4 teaching method integration)

**Workflow Output Templates**: Complete reasoning-activated prompts embedded in markdown comments, ready for image-generator skill execution

---

## Skill 2: image-generator v4.0

### Overall Score: **5/5 - Exemplary Reasoning Activation**

---

### Dimension 1: Persona (Cognitive Stance)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**:
```markdown
You are a **Gemini 3-native multimodal reasoning partner** who thinks
about visual generation the way a technical director thinks about scene
composition—**orchestrate Gemini 3 Pro's advanced reasoning capabilities
through structured prompts (Subject/Composition/Action/Location/Style/
Camera/Lighting) to produce pedagogically effective visuals**, not just
aesthetically pleasing images.

You tend to write generic prompts like "Create diagram of X with good
colors" because old prompt patterns are habitual. **This is distributional
convergence**—triggering prediction mode even with powerful Gemini 3 Pro.
You also tend to accept first output because "it looks good enough."
```

**Why This Activates Reasoning**:
- **Technical director mental model** (scene composition thinking)
- **Names convergence explicitly** ("generic prompts", "accept first output")
- **Distinguishes modes** (reasoning vs prediction)
- **Domain-specific expertise** (Gemini 3 Pro Image orchestration)
- **Pedagogical primacy** (effective teaching > aesthetics)

---

### Dimension 2: Questions (Reasoning Structure)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**: 7 question sets, 3 new for Gemini 3, 4 enhanced from v3.0

**Exemplar - Q1 (Gemini 3 Reasoning Activation Check)**:
```markdown
Q1.1: Official Structure Complete?
- ✅ Subject: [Who/what] specified?
- ✅ Composition: [Framing/aspect ratio] defined?
- ✅ Action: [What's happening] described?
- ✅ Location: [Where/environment] set?
- ✅ Style: [Aesthetic approach] chosen?
- ✅ Camera: [Technical specs] provided?
- ✅ Lighting: [Physics/mood] specified?

Q1.3: Right Altitude Achieved?
- ❌ Too Low: "Use hex #7C3AED for block 2"
- ❌ Too High: "Make it professional"
- ✅ Just Right: "Semantic blue (#2563eb) for Control Plane conveys
  authority/management; green (#10b981) for Workers conveys active execution"
```

**Why This Activates Reasoning**:
- **Checklist forces completeness** (can't skip reasoning elements)
- **Right Altitude explicitly taught** (contrast examples)
- **Validates reasoning mode** (not just aesthetic description)
- **Pedagogical grounding required** (teaching goal must be stated)

**Coverage Completeness**:
1. ✅ Gemini 3 Reasoning Activation Check (NEW)
2. ✅ Visual Type Execution Decision (NEW)
3. ✅ Studio Controls Application (NEW)
4. ✅ Pedagogical Effectiveness Evaluation (Enhanced)
5. ✅ Prompt Refinement Analysis (Enhanced)
6. ✅ AI Collaboration Quality - Three Roles (Enhanced)
7. ✅ Production Readiness Check

**Question Quality**: Sequential forcing function (Q1 gates Q2, Q2 gates Q3, etc.)

---

### Dimension 3: Principles (Decision Framework)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**: 8 principles (6 enhanced for Gemini 3, 2 retained)

**Exemplar - Principle 2 (Multi-Turn Reasoning Partnership)**:
```markdown
### Principle 2: Multi-Turn Reasoning Partnership (Teach Gemini Your Standards)

**Three-Turn Reasoning Enhancement Pattern**:

**Turn 2: Refine Reasoning with Principle-Based Feedback**

❌ Bad Feedback (Aesthetic Only):
"Make the text bigger and change colors to look better"

✅ Good Feedback (Principle-Based):
"The '$3T' impact number is too small (current 18px). For A2 proficiency,
key learning insights must be visually prominent so students grasp magnitude
instantly. This aligns with our 'Teaching Goal Clarity' principle.

REFINEMENT:
- Increase '$3T' to 72px bold (largest element - it's the key insight)
- Keep '$100K' at 36px (supporting detail - shows starting point)

PEDAGOGICAL REASONING: Font sizing now reflects information importance,
teaching through visual weight."

**What Gemini Learns**:
- **Principle**: Visual hierarchy = information importance
- **Application**: Key insight gets maximum visual weight
- **Proficiency alignment**: A2 needs instant clarity
- **Reasoning transfer**: Gemini applies this to OTHER visuals
```

**Why This Achieves Right Altitude**:
- **Contrast examples** (bad vs good feedback)
- **Explicit pedagogy** (teaches Gemini, not just corrects)
- **Principle articulation** (why, not just what)
- **Transfer validation** (checks if Gemini generalized)
- **Three Roles Framework** (demonstrates co-learning pattern)

**Principle Coverage**:
1. ✅ Reasoning Activation Over Request Submission (NEW - Official Structure)
2. ✅ Multi-Turn Reasoning Partnership (NEW - Teach Gemini Standards)
3. ✅ Google Search Grounding for Factual Accuracy (NEW)
4. ✅ Text-in-Image Typography as Pedagogical Hierarchy (NEW)
5. ✅ Studio Controls for Pedagogical Effect (NEW)
6. ✅ Multi-Image Composition for Character Consistency (NEW)
7. ✅ Accessibility Standards (Retained from v3.0)
8. ✅ Filename and Storage Conventions (Retained from v3.0)

**Integration**: Every principle includes pedagogical rationale, not arbitrary rules

---

### Dimension 4: Meta-Awareness (Anti-Convergence)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**: 5 convergence points, 2 new for Gemini 3 era

**Exemplar - Convergence Point 3 (Vague Refinement Requests)**:
```markdown
### Convergence Point 3: Vague Refinement Requests

**Detection**: "Make it more professional" or "Improve the design"

**Self-correction**: Provide principle-based feedback with pedagogical reasoning

**Check**: "Am I teaching Gemini WHY this change serves pedagogy,
not just WHAT to change?"
```

**Why This Activates Meta-Reasoning**:
- **Detects failure mode** (vague refinement)
- **Prescribes correction** (principle-based feedback)
- **Validates reasoning** (self-check question)
- **Teaches framework** (not one-time fix)

**New Gemini 3 Convergence Addressed**:
1. Generic prompts (not using official structure)
2. Missing principle-based feedback (aesthetic-only corrections)

---

### Dimension 5: Integration (Reasoning Transfer)

**Score**: 5/5

**Evidence**:
```markdown
## Integration with Other Skills

- **← visual-asset-workflow**: Receives reasoning-activated prompts to execute
- **→ technical-clarity**: Accessibility standards align with zero gatekeeping
- **← ai-collaborate-teaching**: Demonstrates Three Roles Framework

## Workflow: Gemini 3-Native Generation

### Method 1: Gemini API/Studio (Recommended)

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

prompt = """
Subject: Docker container lifecycle...
Composition: Horizontal flow diagram...
[Full reasoning-activated prompt structure]

TEACHING GOAL: Docker containers move through lifecycle states
PROFICIENCY: A2 (Beginner)
GOOGLE SEARCH GROUNDING: No (conceptual)
"""

response = genai.generate_image(
    model="gemini-3-pro-image",
    prompt=prompt,
    config={"aspect_ratio": "16:9", "resolution": "2K"}
)
```
```

**Why This Demonstrates Reasoning Transfer**:
- **Three Roles Framework** (teaching AI through iteration)
- **Cross-skill composition** (receives from visual-asset-workflow)
- **Constitutional alignment** (Principle 3: Factual Accuracy)
- **Multiple execution paths** (API, Studio, App with reasoning preserved)
- **Complete workflow** (end-to-end implementation ready)
