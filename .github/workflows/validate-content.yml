# Validate Content PRs
#
# Ensures content follows the composable design:
# - Assets must use full CDN URLs (uploaded by author/agent)
# - Local asset references (/img/, /slides/) are rejected
#
# This enforces clean separation between content (managed in git)
# and assets (managed in CDN by authors/agents).
#
# IMPORTANT: Only checks files CHANGED in the PR, not the entire folder.
# This allows gradual migration of existing content.
