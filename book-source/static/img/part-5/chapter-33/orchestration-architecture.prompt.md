## THE STORY

Team lead doesn't write code—team lead coordinates agents. Specs flow down. Results flow up. Contracts ensure alignment without micromanagement. Strategic vs tactical work.

**Emotional Intent**: Role transformation. "I'm not a coder anymore—I'm an architect."

**Visual Metaphor**: Orchestra conductor. Doesn't play instruments, ensures harmony.

**Key Insight**: Orchestration is different skill than implementation. Both valuable.

## CONDENSED BRIEF

Hierarchical architecture showing coordinator managing 5-7 autonomous agents via contracts.

**Top Layer - Coordinator (Human or AI)**:
- Center top: "Orchestrator" (conductor icon)
- Role: "Strategic oversight, contract validation"
- Color: Gold (#fbbf24)
- Size: Large hexagon

**Middle Layer - Communication via Contracts**:
- Arrows flowing down: "Specifications & Contracts"
- Arrows flowing up: "Completed Work & Reports"
- Visual: Two-way communication, async coordination
- Color: Blue (#2563eb) for specs, green (#10b981) for completions

**Bottom Layer - Agent Team (5-7 Specialists)**:
- Seven agents arranged in arc:
  1. "Upload Agent" (worktree 1)
  2. "Grade Agent" (worktree 2)
  3. "Feedback Agent" (worktree 3)
  4. "Test Agent" (worktree 4)
  5. "Docs Agent" (worktree 5)
  6. "Security Agent" (worktree 6)
  7. "Deploy Agent" (worktree 7)
- Each agent: Small box, worktree icon, isolated workspace
- Color: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Size: Small, uniform

**Key Annotations**:
- "Async coordination (no meetings)"
- "Contract-based autonomy (no micromanagement)"
- "Parallel execution (5-7x speedup)"

**Bottom**: "From solo coder to team orchestrator. Different skill, greater leverage."

## PEDAGOGICAL REASONING
Capstone visual showing complete orchestration model. Students see full picture: coordinator role, contract-based communication, agent autonomy, parallel scaling.

---

## COLOR SEMANTICS
- Gold (#fbbf24): Orchestrator (leadership, strategic)
- Blue (#2563eb): Specs/contracts (coordination mechanism)
- Green (#10b981): Completed work (results)
- Purple (#8b5cf6): Agents (specialists, tactical)
- Gray (#6b7280): Structure, connections

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Student grasps in <15 seconds: Orchestrator coordinates 5-7 agents via contracts. Async communication. Parallel execution. Strategic vs tactical roles.

## Alt Text
Hierarchical orchestration architecture: Gold orchestrator (top) coordinates seven purple agents (bottom) via contract-based communication—blue arrows flow specs down, green arrows flow completions up. Shows async, parallel, autonomous coordination model with 5-7x speedup potential.
