## THE STORY

A developer starts a weekend project with excitement. One path leads to frustration—endless loops of "that's not what I meant." The other path leads to satisfaction—clean specification, clean implementation, time for life.

**Emotional Intent**: Relief through contrast. The pain of vague iteration should feel exhausting. The clarity of spec-driven work should feel liberating.

**Visual Metaphor**: Two timelines showing same project, different approaches. Time expands with vague work (elastic, stretched). Time compresses with clear specs (efficient, controlled).

**Key Insight**: Vague prompts cost 3-5x more time than writing clear specs. The math isn't close.

## CONDENSED CREATIVE BRIEF

Two-path timeline comparison showing cost of vague vs clear approaches to AI-driven development.

**Left Path - "Vague Approach"**:
- Title: "Vague Approach: 'Just make it work'"
- Timeline from Saturday 9am to Sunday 9pm (36 hours)
- Five iteration cycles shown as loops:
  - Cycle 1 (3 hours): "Try implementation" → "That's not right"
  - Cycle 2 (4 hours): "Refine prompt" → "Still missing features"
  - Cycle 3 (5 hours): "Add more details" → "Now it's broken"
  - Cycle 4 (6 hours): "Debug and rework" → "Close but..."
  - Cycle 5 (8 hours): "Finally works (barely)"
- Visual: Tangled loops, escalating frustration
- Color: Orange/red gradient (stress, inefficiency)
- End state: "36 hours, exhausted, fragile code"

**Right Path - "Clear Spec Approach"**:
- Title: "Spec-Driven: 'Define success first'"
- Timeline from Saturday 9am to Saturday 9pm (12 hours)
- Three clean phases:
  - Phase 1 (3 hours): "Write specification" (Intent, Success Criteria, Constraints)
  - Phase 2 (6 hours): "AI implements to spec" (smooth, direct)
  - Phase 3 (3 hours): "Validation and polish" (confident)
- Visual: Clean linear flow, calm progression
- Color: Blue/green gradient (control, efficiency)
- End state: "12 hours, confident, robust code + 24 hours for life"

**Visual Elements**:
- Clock icons showing time progression
- Emotion indicators (frustrated face left, calm face right)
- Code quality meter (fragile left, robust right)
- Annotation: "3x time difference—and clear specs scale better"

**Bottom Summary**: "Vague prompts = iteration hell. Clear specs = implementation heaven."

## PEDAGOGICAL REASONING

**Why this visual works**:
1. **Concrete time comparison** - Abstract concept (vague vs clear) becomes tangible hours
2. **Emotional journey** - Students relate to frustration, aspire to calm efficiency
3. **Weekend metaphor** - Relatable timeframe (not abstract "hours saved")
4. **Math is stark** - 36 vs 12 hours isn't debatable, motivates behavior change
5. **Lifecycle view** - Shows full cost (implementation + debugging), not just coding

**Misconception prevented**: "Specs take longer than just coding." Visual proves opposite.

**Proficiency alignment (B1)**: 7-8 elements, clear comparison structure, relatable scenario.

## COLOR SEMANTICS

- **Orange/Red gradient** (#f59e0b → #dc2626): Vague path - stress, inefficiency, escalating chaos
- **Blue/Green gradient** (#2563eb → #10b981): Clear path - control, confidence, success
- **Gray** (#6b7280): Timeline structure, neutral scaffolding
- **White** (#ffffff): Background, clean canvas

## TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY

- **Largest**: Path titles ("Vague Approach" / "Spec-Driven")
- **Medium**: Phase/cycle descriptions, time markers
- **Smallest**: Annotations, end-state summaries, bottom insight

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Student can grasp in <10 seconds**:
- Two paths, different outcomes
- Left = many loops, long time, stress
- Right = clean flow, short time, success
- Conclusion: Clear specs win dramatically

**Measurement**: Student should say "I don't want to be the left path person."
