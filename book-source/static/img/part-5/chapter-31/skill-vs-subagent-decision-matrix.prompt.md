## THE STORY

Developer looks at recurring pattern: "Should I make a Skill or Subagent?" Wrong choice = wasted effort. Right choice = reusable intelligence that compounds.

**Emotional Intent**: Decision confidence through clear criteria.

**Visual Metaphor**: 2×2 matrix with clear boundaries. Know your quadrant, know your answer.

**Key Insight**: Count decisions. 2-4 = Skill. 5+ = Subagent. Simple rule, powerful results.

## CONDENSED BRIEF

2×2 decision matrix helping choose between Skill and Subagent architecture.

**Axes**:
- X-axis: Decision Points (2-4 vs 5+)
- Y-axis: Complexity (Guidance vs Autonomous Reasoning)

**Quadrant 1 (Bottom-Left) - SKILL**:
- Label: "Skill (2-4 decisions, guidance)"
- Examples: "Input validation, Error handling, Format conversion"
- Icon: Checklist
- Color: Blue (#2563eb)
- Use when: "Recurring pattern, limited decisions, apply broadly"

**Quadrant 2 (Top-Right) - SUBAGENT**:
- Label: "Subagent (5+ decisions, autonomous)"
- Examples: "Security audit, Performance optimization, Test generation"
- Icon: Robot/AI brain
- Color: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Use when: "Complex reasoning, many decisions, deep expertise"

**Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Right) - OVER-ENGINEERED**:
- Label: "⚠️ Over-engineered"
- Warning: "Don't create subagent for simple pattern"
- Color: Orange (#f59e0b)

**Quadrant 4 (Top-Left) - UNDER-POWERED**:
- Label: "⚠️ Under-powered"
- Warning: "Skill can't handle this complexity"
- Color: Orange (#f59e0b)

Bottom: "Count decisions → Choose architecture → Build reusable intelligence"

## COLOR SEMANTICS
- Blue (#2563eb): Skill quadrant (guidance, broad application)
- Purple (#8b5cf6): Subagent quadrant (autonomous, deep expertise)
- Orange (#f59e0b): Warning quadrants (wrong choice)
- Gray (#6b7280): Matrix structure
