## THE STORY

Developer chats with AI: "I want a config manager." Casual conversation. But watch—success criteria crystallize from dialogue. Informal → testable. Magic or method? Method.

**Emotional Intent**: Discovery through conversation. "Wait, we just defined success without trying."

**Visual Metaphor**: Ore refining. Raw conversation (ore) → distilled criteria (refined metal).

**Key Insight**: Define success BEFORE building. Counter-intuitive but essential.

## CONDENSED BRIEF

Three-stage transformation showing informal chat becoming formal specification.

**Stage 1 - Informal Chat**:
- Visual: Speech bubbles, casual conversation
- User: "I need something to manage configs"
- AI: "What configs? What problems?"
- User: "JSON files, they're messy..."
- Color: Orange (#f59e0b) - unstructured
- Label: "Casual conversation"

**Stage 2 - Success Criteria Emerge** (arrows showing extraction):
- Visual: Key phrases highlighted, pulled out into list
- Extracted criteria:
  - ✓ "Validates JSON syntax"
  - ✓ "Handles nested structures"
  - ✓ "Clear error messages"
  - ✓ "Loads fast (<100ms)"
- Color: Blue (#2563eb) - crystallization
- Label: "Success criteria emerge from dialogue"

**Stage 3 - Formal Specification**:
- Visual: Structured document with sections
- Shows complete spec:
  - Intent: "Manage configuration files..."
  - Success Criteria: [list from stage 2]
  - Constraints: "Use existing libraries..."
  - Non-Goals: "No GUI, no cloud sync"
- Color: Green (#10b981) - complete, testable
- Label: "Formal spec ready for implementation"

**Bottom**: "Define success first. Build second. Test third. Ship confident."

## COLOR SEMANTICS
- Orange (#f59e0b): Informal (unstructured conversation)
- Blue (#2563eb): Crystallization (criteria emerge)
- Green (#10b981): Formal (complete, testable spec)
- Gray (#6b7280): Transformation arrows

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Student grasps in <10 seconds: Conversation → Criteria → Specification. Evals-first prevents guesswork.
