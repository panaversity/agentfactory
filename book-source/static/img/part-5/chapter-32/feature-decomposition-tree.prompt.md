## THE STORY

Feature seems overwhelming: "Build assignment grader—where do I start?" Decomposition thinking: Break into pieces until each piece is atomic. Tree grows from trunk to branches to leaves.

**Emotional Intent**: Overwhelm → manageability. "I can do small things. Many small things = big thing."

**Visual Metaphor**: Tree. Trunk = feature. Branches = user stories. Leaves = atomic tasks.

**Key Insight**: Decomposition is skill, not magic. Practice the pattern.

## CONDENSED BRIEF

Hierarchical tree showing feature breakdown into atomic tasks.

**Level 1 - Feature (Trunk)**:
- Center top: "Assignment Grader (Feature)"
- Color: Blue (#2563eb)
- Size: Large box

**Level 2 - User Stories (Branches)**:
- Three branches from feature:
  1. "Upload Assignment" (left branch)
  2. "Grade Submission" (center branch)
  3. "Generate Feedback" (right branch)
- Color: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Size: Medium boxes

**Level 3 - Tasks (Leaves)**:
- Upload branch tasks:
  - "Validate file format"
  - "Store in database"
  - "Confirmation message"
- Grade branch tasks:
  - "Run test suite"
  - "Calculate score"
  - "Apply rubric"
- Feedback branch tasks:
  - "Identify errors"
  - "Generate suggestions"
  - "Format report"
- Color: Green (#10b981)
- Size: Small boxes

**Atomic Indicator**: Green checkmark on each leaf task: "✓ Can be completed in one session"

**Bottom**: "One feature → 3 user stories → 9 atomic tasks. Repeat this pattern."

## COLOR SEMANTICS
- Blue (#2563eb): Feature level (strategic)
- Purple (#8b5cf6): User story level (tactical)
- Green (#10b981): Task level (atomic, executable)
- Gray (#6b7280): Tree structure, connections

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Student grasps in <10 seconds: Feature breaks into stories breaks into atomic tasks. Hierarchical thinking enables parallel work.

## Alt Text
Tree hierarchy showing feature decomposition: Assignment Grader (blue trunk) splits into three user stories (purple branches—Upload, Grade, Feedback), each splitting into three atomic tasks (green leaves), demonstrating hierarchical decomposition thinking.
