# Chapter 13: Python UV — The Fastest Python Package Manager

Before you write Python programs, you need professional tools for managing dependencies, virtual environments, and project structure. This beginner-friendly chapter teaches you **UV**, the fastest Python package manager (written in Rust), along with complementary tools **Ruff** (linter/formatter) and **Pyright** (type checker) that integrate seamlessly with UV.

You'll set up production-quality Python environments before writing your first `print()` statement—because modern Python development requires professional-grade project management from day one. This chapter focuses on **tool installation and basic usage**, not Python programming itself. You'll learn through simple AI-driven workflows where you specify what you want and AI helps with commands.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Explain** what UV, Ruff, and Pyright are and why modern Python developers use them
- **Understand** why UV is faster than pip, pipenv, and poetry
- **Recognize** when to use direct commands vs. asking AI for help
- **Describe** what each tool does (package management, formatting, type checking)
- **Install** UV, Ruff, and Pyright on your computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- **Create** and manage Python projects with UV
- **Run** basic formatting and linting commands with Ruff
- **Check** Python code for type errors using Pyright
- **Configure** simple project settings with AI assistance when needed
