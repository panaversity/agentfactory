# Chapter 13: Introduction to Modern Python

Welcome to your journey into Python programming through the lens of AI-native development. In this chapter, you'll discover what Python is, why it matters for building intelligent systems, set up your development environment, and write your first program—all while learning to partner with AI as your thinking assistant.

## What You'll Learn

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** what Python is and why it's central to AI-native software development
2. **Install** Python 3.14.0 on your computer and verify your setup
3. **Write and run** your first Python program that interacts with users using type hints
4. **Use** Claude Code or Gemini CLI as your thinking partner when learning code
5. **Apply** specification-first thinking from Chapter 4 to coding tasks

## Learning Path: Four Progressive Lessons

This chapter progresses from foundational concepts to professional practice:

- **Lesson 1** (45 min): What is Python and why it matters for AIDD
- **Lesson 2** (30 min): Installing Python 3.14.0 and setting up your environment
- **Lesson 3** (45 min): Writing and running your first program with type hints
- **Lesson 4** (30 min, optional): Applying specification-first thinking to code generation

All four lessons are designed for learners at all levels. Lessons 1-3 build essential skills. Lesson 4 connects Python to the AIDD methodology you learned in Chapters 1-11, showing how specification-first thinking and AI partnership transform how you develop.

**Total time**: 2-2.5 hours depending on whether you complete Lesson 4

## Prerequisites

This chapter assumes you've completed:

- **Chapters 1-4**: AIDD fundamentals and the Nine Pillars (specification-first thinking)
- **Chapters 5-6**: Claude Code and Gemini CLI basics
- **Chapter 7**: Bash essentials (terminal commands)
- **Chapter 10**: Prompt engineering (asking AI good questions)

If you haven't completed these chapters, we recommend finishing them first. They establish the foundation that makes this chapter meaningful.

## How to Use AI in This Chapter

Throughout this chapter, you'll see prompts designed for Claude Code or Gemini CLI. Here's how it works:

1. **Understand the concept** (the book explains it)
2. **See minimal code** (the example shows what it does)
3. **Ask your AI partner** (you explore through dialogue)
4. **Extract insight** (you learn why this matters for thinking)

This is the **AI-Driven Way**: you don't memorize Python—you learn to reason about it with intelligent assistance. You're not asking AI to code for you. You're asking AI to help you understand, explain, and explore.

## Key Topics

This chapter covers:

- **Python Fundamentals**: What Python is, its characteristics, and why it dominates AI development
- **Modern Python Syntax**: Type hints and f-strings for clarity and specification-first thinking
- **Setup & Verification**: Installing Python 3.14.0 and confirming your environment
- **First Program**: Writing interactive programs with input/output and type hints
- **Specification-First Coding**: How to apply Chapter 4's methodology to code generation with AI
- **AI Partnership**: Using Claude Code and Gemini CLI as reasoning partners, not just code generators

## Getting Started

Start with Lesson 1 and work through the lessons in order. Each lesson builds on the previous one.

**All four lessons are valuable**. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find something valuable in each lesson. Lesson 4 is particularly useful if you want to deepen your understanding of how AI partnership accelerates development.

**Remember**: Throughout this chapter, ask Claude Code or Gemini CLI questions. They're your thinking partners, not just code generators. Learning to ask good questions is as important as writing code.

<Quiz title="Chapter 4 Quiz" questions={[{"question":"What is the key difference between \u0027external disruption\u0027 and the \u0027internal disruption\u0027 currently happening in software development?","options":{"a":"External disruption is slow, while internal disruption is even slower.","b":"External disruption is when a software company disrupts another industry, while internal disruption is when AI tools transform the software industry itself.","c":"External disruption affects senior developers, while internal disruption affects junior developers.","d":"External disruption is voluntary, while internal disruption is forced upon developers."},"correct_answer":"b","explanation":"The chapter defines the pattern: \u0027External force: Software companies built platforms that competed with traditional retailers... Internal force: The same industry creating the tools is being transformed by them.\u0027"},{"question":"According to the chapter, why is the adoption of AI coding tools happening so much faster than previous technology shifts?","options":{"a":"Because developers are being forced to use them by their managers.","b":"Because there is no external resistance, and developers are adopting them voluntarily for immediate value.","c":"Because the tools are expensive, creating a sense of urgency.","d":"Because previous technology shifts were not very useful."},"correct_answer":"b","explanation":"The text highlights several reasons for the speed, a key one being: \u0027No External Resistance. When AI tools disrupt software development, there\u0027s no external resistance. Developers are adopting these tools voluntarily and enthusiastically...\u0027"},{"question":"What does the chapter mean by the \u0027Recursion Effect\u0027?","options":{"a":"AI coding tools are getting stuck in infinite loops.","b":"Developers are recursively calling the same functions, leading to bugs.","c":"AI coding tools are being used to improve and develop the next version of themselves, creating a rapid improvement cycle.","d":"The process of learning to code is becoming recursive and more difficult."},"correct_answer":"c","explanation":"The chapter explains this \u0027mind-bending\u0027 concept: \u0027AI coding tools are being used to improve AI coding tools... This creates a recursive improvement cycle that has no parallel in previous disruptions.\u0027"},{"question":"How does the impact of AI coding tools on developer roles differ from previous technology shifts like cloud computing or mobile development?","options":{"a":"AI coding tools only affect junior developers.","b":"AI coding tools have a universal impact, affecting every role in the software development value chain simultaneously.","c":"AI coding tools have less impact than previous shifts.","d":"Previous shifts affected all roles, while AI tools only affect a few."},"correct_answer":"b","explanation":"The text states, \u0027AI coding tools affect everyone simultaneously,\u0027 and then lists the impact on junior, mid-level, senior, DevOps, QA, and technical writers, concluding, \u0027There\u0027s nowhere in the software development value chain that remains untouched.\u0027"},{"question":"What is the chapter\u0027s conclusion about the inevitability of AI coding tools?","options":{"a":"The \u0027if\u0027 question is still debated, and their adoption is uncertain.","b":"The \u0027if\u0027 question is already answered; the only remaining question is \u0027how fast?\u0027","c":"The tools are likely a temporary hype or trend.","d":"The adoption will be slow and may take over a decade."},"correct_answer":"b","explanation":"The chapter asserts, \u0027With AI coding, the \u0027if\u0027 question is already answered. The tools exist, they work, they\u0027re being adopted at scale, and they\u0027re improving rapidly. The only remaining question is \u0027how fast?\u0027"}]} />
