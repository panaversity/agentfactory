# Chapter 15: AI Sales Assistant Capstone

You've learned specification-driven development (Chapter 13) and practiced SDD-RI workflows hands-on (Chapter 14). Now you'll prove those skills compound by building a **complete AI Sales Assistant** with four interconnected features—and measuring how much faster each feature builds.

This chapter has one core hypothesis: **Feature 4 should take less than half the time of Feature 1**. The skills, patterns, and specifications you create for Feature 1 will accelerate everything that follows. You'll track your time and see intelligence accumulation in action.

## What You'll Build

An **AI Sales Assistant** with four features that flow into each other:

1. **Lead Profiler** — Analyze a company website, extract structured profile
2. **ICP Scorer** — Score leads against your Ideal Customer Profile criteria
3. **Outreach Generator** — Create personalized messages based on ICP score
4. **Campaign Dashboard** — View all leads, scores, and outreach in one place

Each feature consumes the output of the previous one. By Feature 4, you'll have a complete sales intelligence pipeline.

## The Intelligence Acceleration Challenge

You'll time each feature build. Track your progress:

| Feature | Target Time | Actual Time |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| F1: Lead Profiler | Baseline | _____ min |
| F2: ICP Scorer | Faster than F1 | _____ min |
| F3: Outreach Generator | Faster still | _____ min |
| F4: Campaign Dashboard | Less than 50% of F1 | _____ min |

If F4 takes less than half of F1, you've proven that reusable intelligence works.

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 14 complete**: Spec-Kit Plus installed and configured
- **Chapter 13 complete**: You understand SDD-RI fundamentals
- **Your AI companion ready**: Claude Code or Gemini CLI configured
