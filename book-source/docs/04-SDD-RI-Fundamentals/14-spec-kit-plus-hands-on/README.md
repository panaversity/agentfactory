# Chapter 14: Master Spec-Kit Plus

Welcome to hands-on specification-driven development. This chapter transforms understanding (from Chapter 13) into practice. You won't read about Spec-Kit Plus—you'll **use every command**. You won't learn workflow in isolation—you'll execute it end-to-end on a real project.

**Your Project**: Write a research paper using Spec-Kit Plus workflow. Simple, yes. But it forces you to master `/sp.constitution`, `/sp.specify`, `/sp.clarify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement`—the exact commands you'll use on every project forward.

**Why a Research Paper?** Because a research paper has clear structure, measurable success criteria, and iteration loops—everything that makes Spec-Kit Plus powerful. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- **Chapter 13 Complete**: You understand SDD-RI theory (specification primacy, intelligence accumulation)
- **AI Companion Ready**: Claude Code or Gemini CLI installed and configured
- **Markdown Basics**: From Chapter 10 (how to write markdown)
- **Terminal Comfort**: From Chapter 7 (basic bash commands)
- **Text Editor**: Any editor (VS Code, Cursor, terminal-based)

## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

1. **Spec-Kit Plus Foundation** — What Spec-Kit Plus is, Why this book uses it, How it orchestrates SDD-RI phases
2. **Installation & Setup** — Configure your AI companion, understand project structure, prepare your workspace
3. **Constitution Phase** — Using `/sp.constitution` to define project-wide quality standards for research papers
4. **Specify Phase** — Using `/sp.specify` to write clear, testable requirements from vague project ideas
5. **Clarify Phase** — Using `/sp.clarify` to identify missing constraints and edge cases iteratively
6. **Plan Phase** — Using `/sp.plan` to generate architecture and design decisions
7. **Tasks Phase** — Using `/sp.tasks` to decompose work into atomic, checkpoint-driven units
8. **Implement Phase** — Using `/sp.implement` to execute tasks with AI collaboration
9. **Designing Reusable Intelligence** — Creating reusable components (skills, subagents, tools) using P+Q+P pattern
10. **Brownfield Adoption** — Adding Spec-Kit Plus to existing projects safely
11. **Capstone Execution** — Applying the full workflow end-to-end, demonstrating mastery through skill reuse
12. **Quiz** — Validate your understanding of each command and when to use it

By the end, you'll have shipped a research paper **entirely through Spec-Kit Plus workflow**—and you'll understand how to apply this to any project.
