# Chapter 32: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On

Welcome to hands-on specification-driven development. This chapter transforms understanding (from Chapter 32) into practice. You won't read about specifications-you'll write them. You won't learn about AI collaboration - you'll build project with your AI companion from specifications to implementation. Chapter 32 gave you the map. Chapter 33 teaches you to drive.
## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you'll master:

1. **Spec-Kit Plus Foundation** - Understand WHAT Spec-Kit Plus is, WHY this book uses it, and HOW it implements SDD-RI concepts
2. **Spec-Kit Plus Architecture** - Recognize Horizontal Intelligence (ADRs + PHRs) and Vertical Intelligence (orchestrator + subagents)
3. **Installation & Configuration** - Install Spec-Kit Plus, configure your AI tool, initialize projects
4. **Evals-First Collaboration** - How to explore problem space with AI BEFORE writing formal specifications
5. **Constitution Creation** - Setting project-wide quality standards that cascade to all features
6. **Specification Writing** - Creating clear, testable requirements using SMART criteria
7. **Iterative Refinement** - Using `/sp.clarify` to identify and resolve specification gaps
8. **Architecture Planning** - Generating implementation plans and documenting decisions with ADRs
9. **Task Decomposition** - Breaking plans into atomic work units with checkpoint-driven execution
10. **AI-Driven Implementation** - Orchestrating code generation with systematic validation protocols
11. **Reusable Intelligence Design** - Transforming workflow patterns into skills and subagents that compound across projects
12. **Independent Workflow** - Applying all skills end-to-end without guidance

Most importantly, you'll build the muscle memory for specification-first thinking AND intelligence accumulation that makes you dramatically faster in Chapters 32 and beyond. Let's build something real.
