# Chapter 8: AI-Native IDEs - Zed, Cursor, and the Future of Development

Modern development environments integrate AI directly into the editor, transforming how we write, debug, and refactor code. This chapter explores **AI-native IDEs**—development tools designed from the ground up for seamless AI collaboration, not AI features bolted onto traditional editors.

You'll install and configure **Zed** (Anthropic's blazingly fast IDE with built-in AI), explore **Cursor** (VS Code fork with enhanced AI capabilities), and develop criteria for choosing the right AI-native environment for your workflow.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Explain** what makes an IDE "AI-native" vs traditional editors with AI plugins
- **Understand** the trade-offs between different AI-native development environments
- **Install** and configure Zed IDE on your system (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Navigate** Zed's interface and AI collaboration features
- **Compare** Zed, Cursor, and other AI-native IDEs based on selection criteria
- **Choose** the right AI-native IDE for different project types and workflows
- **Integrate** Zed with your existing development toolchain (Git, terminals, extensions)
- **Leverage** AI assistance for code completion, refactoring, and debugging

## Why This Matters

The IDE is where you spend most of your development time. Choosing the right AI-native environment dramatically impacts:

- **Productivity**: How quickly you can translate ideas into working code
- **Learning curve**: How easily AI can explain unfamiliar codebases
- **Code quality**: How effectively AI catches errors and suggests improvements
- **Workflow integration**: How smoothly AI collaborates with your existing tools

Traditional IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim) added AI features as plugins. AI-native IDEs **designed their architecture around AI collaboration from day one**, resulting in fundamentally different capabilities and user experiences.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- **Chapter 5**: Claude Code installed and configured
- **Chapter 6**: Gemini CLI (optional comparison point)
- **Chapter 7**: Basic Bash terminal proficiency
- **System requirements**: Modern computer with stable internet connection

## What's Next

After mastering AI-native IDEs in Chapter 8, you'll proceed to **Chapter 9: Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development**, where you'll learn version control workflows that make AI-assisted development safe and auditable.

The skills you build here—choosing tools strategically, configuring AI collaboration, and integrating with existing workflows—become foundational for all professional development work in later parts of this book.
