# Chapter 8: Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

## Overview

This chapter teaches you how to use Git and GitHub as essential safety mechanisms for AI-assisted development. When working with AI coding assistants like Claude Code or Gemini CLI, Git provides a crucial safety net—allowing you to experiment freely, track every change, and undo mistakes instantly. You'll learn Git not by memorizing commands, but by asking your AI assistant to perform Git operations using natural language.

The chapter follows an **AI-native teaching approach**: instead of traditional command memorization, you'll learn to collaborate with AI assistants to manage version control. This mirrors how professional developers actually work with AI tools—understanding concepts deeply while letting AI handle syntax and execution details.

By the end of this chapter, you'll confidently use Git for safe experimentation with AI-generated code, connect your projects to GitHub for backup and portfolio building, set up a professional IDE with Git integration, and understand collaborative workflows through pull requests.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Recognize why Git is essential** for safe AI-assisted development and explain it in your own words
- **Install and configure Git** on your specific operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **Create a GitHub account** and understand GitHub as cloud backup and collaboration platform
- **Perform core Git workflows** (init, status, add, commit, push) using natural language prompts to AI assistants
- **Safely undo changes** at different stages using appropriate Git commands via AI guidance
- **Create and use Git branches** to test AI-generated changes before merging to main code
- **Connect local repositories to GitHub** for backup, sharing, and portfolio building
- **Create pull requests** that document AI assistance and demonstrate professional Git workflows
- **Set up a modern IDE** (VS Code, Cursor, or Zed) with Git integration and AI coding extensions
- **Integrate all Git skills** in a realistic capstone project where AI generates code and you manage Git for safety

<Quiz title="Chapter 2 Quiz" questions={[{"question":"What did Sarah Chen, a solo founder, build in forty-eight hours with the help of Claude Code?","options":{"a":"A simple personal blog.","b":"A complete customer analytics dashboard for 1,200 customers.","c":"A mobile game.","d":"A tutorial on PHP."},"correct_answer":"b","explanation":"The text explicitly states, \u0027In forty-eight hours, she\u0027d built a complete customer analytics dashboard that two months ago would have required a team of five developers and three weeks of work... Her dashboard processed real-time data for 1,200 customers.\u0027"},{"question":"How does the speed of the current AI coding revolution compare to previous transitions in software development?","options":{"a":"It is happening over 10-15 years, similar to past transitions.","b":"It is happening much slower than previous transitions.","c":"It is happening in months, not years.","d":"The speed is exactly the same."},"correct_answer":"c","explanation":"The chapter notes, \u0027Previous transitions... took 10-15 years... The AI coding revolution is happening in months, not years.\u0027"},{"question":"According to the Stack Overflow 2024 Developer Survey cited in the chapter, what percentage of professional developers are already using AI coding tools?","options":{"a":"10%","b":"44%","c":"62%","d":"76%"},"correct_answer":"c","explanation":"The text provides the statistic: \u002776% of professional developers are using or plan to use AI coding tools, with 62% already using them—up from 44% last year (Stack Overflow 2024 Developer Survey).\u0027"},{"question":"What is the chapter\u0027s main answer to questions like \u0027Am I too late?\u0027 or \u0027Will this replace me?\u0027 for developers?","options":{"a":"It is too late for new developers to enter the field.","b":"AI will replace most developers within the next year.","c":"This is the best time in decades to be learning software development because of AI.","d":"Developers should switch to a different career."},"correct_answer":"c","explanation":"The text directly answers, \u0027The answer to all four is the same, and it might surprise you: This is the best time in decades to be learning software development. Not despite AI. Because of it.\u0027"},{"question":"How is the role of a developer evolving in the AI era, according to the chapter?","options":{"a":"From a high-level architect to a low-level coder.","b":"It is not evolving; the tasks remain the same.","c":"From a typist writing code line by line to an orchestrator managing AI agents.","d":"Developers are now primarily focused on hardware and infrastructure."},"correct_answer":"c","explanation":"The chapter states, \u0027Your role as a developer is evolving from typist (writing code line by line) to orchestrator (managing AI agents, making architectural decisions, exercising judgment).\u0027"}]} />
