You're starting your programming journey and want to learn about Python before diving into coding. You could:
- Open multiple browser tabs
- Search through scattered articles
- Find reliable sources
- Read and compare information
- Synthesize what you've learned

Or you could just ask Gemini:

```
What is Python and what is it used for in 2025?
```

Within seconds, Gemini searches the web, finds reliable sources, and gives you a current answer with citations. **This is the power of built-in tools** - your AI doesn't just answer from memory, it actively reaches out to get current information, read your files, and execute commands.

In this lesson, you'll learn what Gemini can actually do for you as you learn to code.

---

## Tools Activate Automatically

Here's the key insight that changes everything: **You don't invoke tools manually.** You ask naturally, and Gemini decides which tool to use.

When you ask Gemini a question, it analyzes what you need:
- Current information from the web? → Google Search tool activates
- Read a file in your project? → File operations tool activates
- Run a terminal command? → Shell integration activates
- Fetch a specific webpage? → Web fetch tool activates

You'll know a tool is active when you see visual indicators:
- 🔍 **Searching the web...**
- 📁 **Reading file...**
- ⚡ **Running command...**
- 🌐 **Fetching webpage...**

Let's see each tool in action.

---

> What is Git and why do developers use it?

🔍 Searching the web...

Git is a version control system - a tool that tracks changes to your code.

**What It Does:**
- Saves a history of every change you make to your files
- Lets you go back to previous versions if something breaks
- Allows multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts
- Creates backups of your work

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you have a document:
- Version 1: "Draft 1"
- Version 2: "Added chapter 3"
- Version 3: "Fixed typos"

Instead of saving "Draft1_final_real_v2.docx", Git automatically tracks all these versions.

**Why Developers Care:**
- Never lose work (every version is saved)
- Collaborate with teammates safely
- Experiment without fear (easy to revert changes)
- Professional standard (most tech jobs require Git)

**You'll Learn Git In:**
Chapter 10 of this book - we'll teach you Bash first (Chapter 7) so you're ready.
