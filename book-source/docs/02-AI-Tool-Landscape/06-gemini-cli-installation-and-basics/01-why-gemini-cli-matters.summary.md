### Core Concept
AI tool selection requires evaluating six key dimensions—not choosing based on hype or single features. Gemini CLI's open source model and free tier democratize AI-augmented development, making powerful coding assistance accessible regardless of economic status.

### Key Mental Models
- **Six Dimensions Framework**: Evaluate AI tools across licensing, cost, context window, extensibility, interface preference, and support model—no single dimension determines the "best" tool
- **Open Source Ecosystem Effect**: Open tools evolve beyond original creators' vision through forks (Qwen Code), community extensions, and custom adaptations
- **MCP as Universal Adapter**: Model Context Protocol standardizes how AI connects to external tools and data, like USB standardized device connections

### Critical Patterns
- Compare tools across all six dimensions before choosing—context matters more than features
- Match context window size to project scope: 200K tokens (~500 pages) vs 1M tokens (~2,500 pages)
- MCP servers extend AI tools without waiting for vendor roadmaps
- Free tiers enable experimentation; paid services provide enterprise features and SLAs

### Common Mistakes
- Choosing tools based on cost alone—ignoring extensibility or context window needs
- Assuming proprietary means better—missing ecosystem benefits of open source
- Underestimating context window impact when working with large codebases
- Treating AI tool selection as permanent—different projects may need different tools
