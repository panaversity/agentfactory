# Chapter 6: Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere

You've learned Claude Code inside and out. Now it's time for the bigger picture: **choosing the right AI tool for the job**.

Two months after Claude Code launched in October 2024, Google released Gemini CLI. On the surface, it looks like a competitor. But dig deeper, and you discover something different—not better or worse, just *different*. Open source. Generous free tier. One million token context window. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which means you can extend it with your own tools.

This chapter isn't about Google versus Anthropic. It's about **building judgment**—understanding when each tool is the right choice, and why context matters more than brand loyalty.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have two powerful AI development tools at your command, each suited to different workflows and scenarios.

## What You'll Learn

Through five interconnected lessons, you'll understand:

- **Why open source matters**: Gemini CLI's transparency, customizability, and community model—and when those advantages matter for your work
- **Installation and getting started**: Quick setup on Windows, macOS, or Linux with a generous free tier (no credit card required)
- **How your AI reads the world**: Using built-in tools to access files, fetch web content, and execute shell commands without memorizing command syntax
- **Memory and context systems**: Saving and reusing conversation context across days so you don't re-explain your project every session
- **Extending your tools**: Installing and configuring MCP servers to connect Gemini CLI to your own systems (GitHub, databases, company tools)
- **The decision framework**: When to choose Gemini CLI, when to choose Claude Code, and when to reach for something else entirely
