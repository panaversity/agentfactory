# Lesson [N]: [LESSON TITLE]

**Duration**: [X.X hours] | **Proficiency Target**: [A2|B1|B2] | **Bloom's Level**: [Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create]

---

## Opening Hook (2-3 paragraphs)

[**Important**: Write an engaging introduction that hooks the reader within the first 2-3 paragraphs. Establish the "why" before the "what." For conceptual lessons, this might be a story or real-world example. For technical lessons, this might be a problem the lesson solves.]

[Example structure]:
- Start with a relatable problem or situation
- Show the consequence of not understanding this lesson
- Preview what students will be able to do after this lesson
- Connect to the previous lesson or broader Chapter 31 journey

---

## Part A: [Major Section Title]

**Duration**: [X min]

[**Content Structure for Your Lesson Type**]:

### For Conceptual Sections:
- Real-world context and examples
- Key concepts introduced gradually
- Analogies and connections to familiar ideas
- Reflection prompts ("Pause and Reflect" style)

### For Technical Sections:
- Concept explanation (WHAT and WHY)
- Step-by-step walkthrough or demonstration
- Code examples (if applicable) with explanations
- Common mistakes or misconceptions addressed

## Part B: [Major Section Title]

**Duration**: [X min]

[Continue with second major section following the same structure...]

---

## Part C: [Major Section Title]

**Duration**: [X min]

[Add additional sections as needed from the lesson plan...]

---

## Part D: [Final Content Section or Practice]

**Duration**: [X min]

[Final major content section, lab activity, or capstone for this lesson...]

---

## Common Pitfalls / Misconceptions (Optional)

[**For Technical Lessons**: Add a section highlighting common mistakes students make with this concept.]

**Red Flags to Watch**:
- ⚠️ [Common mistake 1]: [Why this happens] → [How to avoid it]
- ⚠️ [Common mistake 2]: [Why this happens] → [How to avoid it]
- ⚠️ [Common mistake 3]: [Why this happens] → [How to avoid it]

## Try With AI

**Tool**: [ChatGPT web | Claude Code | Gemini CLI | [Your learner's AI companion]]

**Duration**: [X-Y minutes]

### Setup
[Brief context: What tool are we using? Why? What's the learning goal?]

**Example**: "We're using Claude Code to validate our specification. Your role is to review AI feedback and understand why clarity matters for implementation."

### Prompt Set (Progressive Scope)

**Prompt 1** (Foundation):
```
[Copyable prompt for first activity]
```

**Expected Output**:
[What a correct/complete response looks like. 2-3 sentences.]

---

**Prompt 2** (Building):
```
[Copyable prompt for second activity]
```

**Expected Output**:
[What success looks like for this prompt. 2-3 sentences.]

---

**Prompt 3** (Challenge — Optional Stretch):
```
[Copyable prompt for advanced variation or extension]
```

**Expected Output**:
[What excellence looks like for advanced students. 2-3 sentences.]

---

### Reflection Question

**Think About**: [One key question that ties the AI interaction back to lesson learning objectives]

**Example**: "How did your AI partner help you understand why specification clarity matters for implementation?"

---

### Safety & Ethics Note

[Brief guardrail on responsible AI use specific to this lesson's activities.]

**Example**: "AI feedback on specifications surfaces possible gaps. You're responsible for deciding which gaps matter for YOUR project. Don't blindly accept all feedback—use AI as a thought partner, not an oracle."

---

### Next Step (Self-Directed Extension)

[Optional suggestion for how students can extend this activity independently.]

**Example**: "Challenge: Run this activity on a specification from your own project. Did you discover similar gaps that AI would have caught?"
