# Chapter 31: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On

Welcome to hands-on specification-driven development. This chapter transforms understanding (from Chapter 30) into practice. You won't read about specifications—you'll write them. You won't learn about AI collaboration—you'll build projects with your AI companion from specifications to implementation.

## The Spec-Kit Plus Loop

This chapter teaches the **three-phase repeatable workflow** from Chapter 30 and the Horizontal Additions in our Toolkit :

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│  1. SPECIFY → 2. PLAN → 3. TASKS → Code   │
│      ↑                              ↓       │
│      └──────────── Iterate ─────────┘       │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Through eight interconnected lessons, you'll master each phase of this workflow. You'll experience the **cascade effect** where specification quality determines plan quality, which determines task quality, which determines code quality. Most importantly, you'll build the muscle memory for specification-first thinking that makes you dramatically faster in Chapters 32 and beyond.

Whether you're eager to start coding or skeptical that specs are worth the time, this chapter proves the value through direct experience: building projects specification-first is faster, more reliable, and more scalable than code-first development.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Master the Spec-Kit Plus Loop**: Execute the complete workflow, understanding how each phase builds on the previous and why the loop is repeatable for iterative refinement
- **Write SMART acceptance criteria**: Create testable, unambiguous success criteria that prevent misinterpretation—learning the difference between "works correctly" (vague) and "returns 12 when given 3 \* 4" (SMART)
- **Recognize quality through cascade effects**: Understand how specification quality determines plan quality, which determines task quality, which determines code quality—and how to diagnose problems at the right level
- **Build from specifications, not code**: Implement a Python calculator by starting with specifications and letting AI agents handle implementation—experiencing the paradigm shift from code-first to spec-first
- **Validate implementations against specs**: Use specifications as the source of truth for testing—writing test scenarios that verify code matches intent, not just "runs without errors"
- **Write production-grade specifications**: Create a real-world grading system specification with edge cases, error handling, and extensibility considerations—building the foundation for Chapter 32's capstone
- **Collaborate specification-first with AI**: Develop fluency in the back-and-forth dialogue with AI companions where you provide intent and critique output while AI handles structure and completeness

## Ready?

The next eight lessons will transform you from code-first to specification-first developer. You'll stop opening VS Code as the first step and start writing specifications. You'll stop debugging mysterious behaviors and start validating against explicit acceptance criteria. You'll stop explaining projects verbally and start pointing to specifications that capture exact intent.

Let's build this together.
