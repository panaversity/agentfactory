# Ask: Why Do Specs Matter NOW? The AI Moment

## The Question

Specifications have existed since the 1970s. **Why is SDD only becoming standard practice NOW, in 2025?**

If specs were so good, why didn't everyone use them 20 years ago?

## What Changed: Three Convergent Forces

**1. AI got good enough to generate production code (2025+)**

- Before Summer 2025: AI-generated code was often broken, unreliable
- 2025+: LLMs can generate working, tested code from clear specifications

**2. Developers discovered specs save iteration time with AI agents**

- Vague prompt → 5-10 iterations to get it right
- Clear spec → Working code on first or second try
- Time savings became obvious and measurable

**3. AI agents are literal-minded (need specs more than humans do)**

- Human developers: Can infer intent, ask clarifying questions, understand context
- AI agents: Take instructions literally, follow patterns, don't "read between the lines"
- Specifications provide the explicit detail AI agents need

**The Timeline:**

- **Before 2025**: AI-generated broken code → Specs weren't worth the effort
- **2025+**: AI generates working code from specs → Specs became essential

## Historical Context: Why Specs Failed Before

Understanding why previous specification approaches failed helps us appreciate why SDD succeeds now.

### 1970s: Formal Methods

**Promise**: Mathematically prove code is correct  
**Reality**: Too rigid, only for critical systems (aerospace, nuclear)  
**Why it failed**: Required PhD-level math, impractical for normal software  
**Lesson**: Specs are powerful but need the right context

### 1980s: Design by Contract

**Promise**: Embed specs in code itself (pre/post conditions)  
**Reality**: Only worked in Eiffel language, wasn't mainstream  
**Why it failed**: Language-specific, not adopted widely  
**Lesson**: Specs need separation from code

### 2000s: Model-Driven Development

**Promise**: Specs (UML models) → automatic code generation
**Reality**: Tools created lock-in, models became outdated, specs and code diverged
**Lesson**: Code generation from specs is hard; abstraction level matters

### 2010s: Agile Backlash

**Promise**: Minimize specs, maximize iteration
**Reality**: Lost institutional knowledge, teams couldn't scale, documentation disappeared
**Lesson**: No specs is also bad; balance is needed

### 2025+: SDD Emerges

**Why NOW?**:

1. AI agents are powerful enough to generate correct code
2. AI agents are literal-minded (NEED explicit specs)
3. Specs became the interface between humans and AI
4. Cost-benefit finally works: specs save time with AI

**The math**:

- Before: 2 hours vague prompt + 10 hours iteration = 12 hours
- Now: 3 hours spec + 30 mins iteration = 3.5 hours
- **SDD wins for anything >4 hours of work**

## The Specific Insight: AI Agents Demand Clarity

Ask your companion:

```
Why do AI agents specifically benefit from specs? What's different about
how AI agents work compared to human colleagues?
```

**Human colleagues can:**

- Ask clarifying questions
- Use context and experience to infer intent
- Notice edge cases and flag them
- Work from sketches and diagrams

**AI agents can:**

- Follow explicit instructions precisely
- **NOT** infer your intent
- **NEED** unambiguous specifications
- Generate code from detailed descriptions

**The Key Shift:**

- **Before AI**: Specs were nice but not essential (humans could improvise)
- **With AI**: Specs became essential (AI can't improvise)

This is why SDD emerged now. **AI made specs mandatory, not optional.**

## The MDD Lesson: Why Code Generation Failed Before

Model-Driven Development (MDD) promised automatic code generation in the 2000s. It mostly failed. Understanding why helps us see what makes SDD different.

### MDD's Problems

1. **Abstraction mismatch**: Models sat at awkward level (too detailed for managers, too vague for developers)
2. **Tool lock-in**: Custom code generators created dependency on specific tools
3. **Incomplete models**: Models didn't capture edge cases, so developers hand-edited generated code
4. **Divergence**: Code and models went out of sync (which is source of truth?)

### Why SDD Succeeds Where MDD Failed

1. **Natural language specs**: More flexible than UML/DSL, less formal but more practical
2. **LLMs need no custom tools**: Any LLM can generate code from natural language
3. **Less lock-in**: Specs are markdown/prose, not proprietary format
4. **Faster feedback**: Spec changes → regenerated code in minutes (not hours)
5. **Better models**: 2024 LLMs understand nuance and edge cases better than 2004 code generators

## The Market Validation: When Did SDD Emerge?

**2025 Timeline** shows rapid industry adoption:

- GitHub releases Spec-Kit (formal SDD framework)
- Anthropic integrates Spec-Kit Plus with Claude Code
- Google Gemini CLI adds spec support
- Multiple startups build spec-driven tools
- Industry calls 2025 "the year specs became essential"

**Why Now?**:

- ChatGPT (Nov 2022) created mainstream AI coding
- Developers experienced 10 iterations for simple features
- 2025: "Wait, what if we just wrote a clear spec?"
- Pattern discovered: Clear spec → correct code, first try
- Tools emerged to systematize this pattern

## Your Personal Realization

Ask yourself:

```
When have I experienced this problem?
- Vague description → code that's wrong
- Had to iterate 5+ times to get it right
- Blamed the AI, but really I was being vague

When would a spec have helped?
```

Think of a recent project. How much time would you have saved with a clear spec upfront?

This isn't theoretical. This is your actual experience being addressed.

## The Bigger Insight: Specifications Enable Parallelization

Ask your companion:

```
How do specs enable team parallelization? If my team could do more work
in parallel, what's the mechanism?
```

Your companion will explain:

> "With clear specs, team members (or AI agents) can work independently
> on different features without constant communication.
>
> Feature A spec: clearly defined interfaces
> Feature B spec: clearly defined interfaces
>
> Developer A works on Feature A
> Developer B works on Feature B
>
> They integrate at defined interfaces (no constant meetings needed)
>
> Without specs: constant communication, bottlenecks, miscommunication
> With specs: async parallelization, clear boundaries, independent work"

**This is why SDD is a scalability breakthrough, not just a quality improvement.**

## Key Realization

SDD isn't a new invention. Specifications have existed for decades.

**What's new is the NECESSITY and the TOOLS.**

- **Necessity**: AI agents need specs (humans can improvise; AI can't)
- **Tools**: Spec-Kit, Kiro, etc., make specs systematic (not ad-hoc)
- **Timing**: 2025 is the moment AI capability and spec tooling converged
