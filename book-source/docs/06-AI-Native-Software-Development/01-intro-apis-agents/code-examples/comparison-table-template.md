# LLM vs Agent Comparison Table

Use this template for your Lesson 1.2 exercise.

## Instructions

Fill in at least 5 items in each column. Think about:
- What can ChatGPT do right now?
- What would DocuBot need to do that ChatGPT can't?

---

| What ChatGPT Can Do | What DocuBot Agent Will Do |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Answer general knowledge questions | Search MY uploaded documents |
| Generate text based on prompts | Remember our conversation context |
| Write code when asked | Cite which document the answer came from |
| Summarize text I paste in | Update its knowledge when I add documents |
| ... (add more) | ... (add more) |

## Reflection Questions

After completing your table, ask yourself:

1. Why can't a basic LLM search your documents?
2. What does "memory" mean for an agent?
3. How would DocuBot know which document to cite?

These questions help you understand why we need to build an **agent**, not just use a chatbot.
