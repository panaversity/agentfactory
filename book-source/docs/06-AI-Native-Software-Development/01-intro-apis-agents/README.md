# Chapter 1: Introduction to AI APIs & Agents

Welcome to your journey into AI-driven development! This chapter establishes the foundational concepts you need before writing any agent code.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will:

1. **Understand what APIs are** and how your code communicates with AI services
2. **Distinguish LLMs from Agents** — know why DocuBot needs agent capabilities
3. **Set up your development environment** with UV, Python, and OpenAI SDK
4. **See the complete architecture** of what you'll build across 16 chapters

## Chapter Overview

| Lesson | Title | Duration | What You'll Do |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1.1 | [API Fundamentals](./01-api-fundamentals.md) | 30 min | Understand APIs, verify your OpenAI key works |
| 1.2 | [LLM vs Agent](./02-llm-vs-agent.md) | 35 min | Create comparison table showing why DocuBot needs agents |
| 1.3 | [Environment Setup](./03-environment-setup.md) | 45 min | Install UV, create project, configure .env |
| 1.4 | [Architecture Overview](./04-architecture-overview.md) | 35 min | Document the complete system you'll build |

**Total Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Prerequisites

**None!** This is the starting point. You need:

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- An OpenAI API key (we'll guide you through getting one)
- Curiosity and willingness to learn

## Your DocuBot Journey Begins

Throughout this course, you'll build **DocuBot** — a production-quality RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can:

- Answer questions about your documents
- Remember conversation context
- Cite sources for its answers
- Deploy to production with a real frontend

This chapter gives you the mental models and environment setup to make that journey successful.

## Learning Approach

Every lesson follows the same pattern:

1. **Learn the concept** — understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **See the analogy** — relate new ideas to things you already know
3. **Apply to DocuBot** — immediately use what you learned on your project

Let's begin!

## Chapter Summary

After completing this chapter, you will have:

| Artifact | Description | Lesson |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `test_api.py` | Working API verification script | 1.1 |
| Comparison table | LLM vs Agent capabilities | 1.2 |
| Configured environment | UV + virtual env + .env | 1.3 |
| `architecture.md` | System roadmap document | 1.4 |

### Key Takeaways

1. **APIs are bridges** — They let your code communicate with AI services through requests and responses
2. **Agents are more than LLMs** — They have tools, memory, and can take actions to complete complex tasks
3. **Environment setup prevents headaches** — Taking time to configure properly saves hours of debugging
4. **Architecture guides building** — Understanding the whole system helps each piece make sense
