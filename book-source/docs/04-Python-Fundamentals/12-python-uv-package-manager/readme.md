# Chapter 12: The Lightning Python Stack — uv, Zed, Ruff & Pyright

Welcome to your first hands-on Python chapter! This beginner-friendly chapter teaches you how to set up a **modern Python development environment** using professional tools: **uv** (package manager), **Zed** (AI-first IDE), **Ruff** (linter/formatter), and **Pyright** (type checker).

**Why This Chapter Matters**: Before you write Python programs, you need the right tools installed and working. This chapter focuses on **tool installation and basic usage**—not Python programming itself. You'll learn through simple AI-driven workflows where you specify what you want and AI helps with commands.

**What You're Learning**: How to install and use professional Python tools, not Python syntax. Code examples are minimal (1-3 lines) and exist only to prove tools work. You'll learn Python programming in later chapters—here, you're just getting your toolchain set up.

**Beginner-Friendly Approach**: Each tool is taught separately with clear step-by-step instructions. You'll learn what each tool does, how to install it, and how to use basic commands. AI assistance is available when you need it.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

### Knowledge (Understanding)
- **Explain** what uv, Zed, Ruff, and Pyright are and why each tool exists
- **Understand** why modern Python developers use these tools
- **Recognize** when to use direct commands vs. asking AI for help
- **Describe** what each tool does (package management, editing, formatting, type checking)

### Skills (Application)
- **Install** uv, Zed, Ruff, and Pyright on your computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- **Open** and use Zed IDE for Python projects
- **Run** basic formatting and linting commands with Ruff
- **Check** Python code for type errors using Pyright
- **Create** simple configurations with AI assistance when needed

### AI Partnership (Beginner Level)
- **Direct Commands**: Learn to run tools yourself with simple commands
- **AI Help**: Ask AI when you need help with configuration or troubleshooting
- **Understanding**: Focus on what tools do, not memorizing every option
