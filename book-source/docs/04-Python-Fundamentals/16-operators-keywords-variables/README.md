# Chapter 16: Operators

In the previous chapters, you learned about data types and how to store values in variables. Now it's time to learn what you can DO with that data using operators—the symbols that tell Python to perform actions.

Operators are the verbs of programming. Data types are the nouns (what you work with). Operators are the verbs (what you do with them). Together, they let you build calculations, make decisions, and update values.

## What You'll Master

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Capstone Calculator

## Chapter Structure

### Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators
Discover Python's seven arithmetic operators through problem-solving. You'll calculate fuel usage, distribute items into groups, and find remainders—all skills you'll use constantly.

**Topics**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`, operator precedence

### Lesson 2: Comparison Operators
Learn to ask True/False questions. Is this password correct? Is the user old enough? Is this value within range? Comparisons are the foundation for all decision-making in code.

**Topics**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, boolean results

### Lesson 3: Logical Operators
Combine multiple conditions into complex decisions. Must be 18 AND have a license. Can pay with credit OR debit. These operators let you express real-world logic.

**Topics**: `and`, `or`, `not`, truth tables, short-circuit evaluation

### Lesson 4: Assignment Operators
Update variables efficiently with shortcuts. Instead of `score = score + 10`, write `score += 10`. Cleaner, faster, and the standard pattern for counters and accumulators.

**Topics**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, counter pattern, accumulator pattern

### Lesson 5: Capstone - Calculator Program
Build a complete calculator that uses all four operator types. Get user input, perform calculations, validate with comparisons, combine conditions with logic, and track running totals.

**Challenge**: Integrate arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators into one working program.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should be comfortable with:
- Variables and assignment (Chapter 14)
- Basic data types: int, float, bool, str (Chapter 15)
- The `print()` and `input()` functions (Chapter 14)

## What's Next

After mastering operators, you'll move on to:
- **Chapter 17: Strings & Type Casting** — Text manipulation and converting between types
- **Chapter 18: Control Flow & Loops** — Using comparison and logical operators in `if` statements and loops
