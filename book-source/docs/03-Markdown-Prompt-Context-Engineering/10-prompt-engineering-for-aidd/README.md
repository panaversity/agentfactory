# Chapter 10: Prompt Engineering for Strategic Product Intelligence

**Part 3: Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering**

---

## Strategic Frame: From Coding Productivity to Documentation Mastery

Most prompt engineering tutorials teach you to "write code faster with ChatGPT." **This chapter teaches something more valuable**: How to use AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) to systematically explore technical documentation and generate professional markdown content.

**You are a Developer learning a new framework.** You have 45 minutes before the architecture meeting. You cannot read 100+ pages of documentation linearly. But you CAN use AI agents to:

- Extract core design patterns and architectural decisions
- Identify framework trade-offs and constraints
- Generate production-quality documentation (READMEs, API docs, tutorials)
- Build deep conceptual understanding through systematic exploration

This is **strategic learning and documentation work**, not coding. The same skills apply to:

- **Framework evaluation**: Understanding design decisions to choose the right tool
- **Documentation creation**: Generating consistent, professional markdown content
- **Knowledge transfer**: Building mental models of complex systems quickly

## What You'll Learn

This chapter transforms prompt engineering from a productivity hack into a strategic capability through 8 lessons + 1 capstone project:

**Stage 1: Foundation (Lessons 1-2)** — Manual mental models (NO AI)
- How AI agents think differently than search engines or autocomplete
- Specification-first approach: Define WHAT you need before writing prompts

**Stage 2: Collaboration (Lessons 3-5)** — AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker
- The 4-layer context model for documentation exploration
- Claude Code tool ecosystem (Read, WebFetch, Grep, Glob, Bash)
- Gemini CLI commands (@filename, !command, custom TOML workflows)

**Stage 3: Intelligence Design (Lessons 6-7)** — Reusable patterns
- Create prompt skills for recurring documentation/markdown tasks
- Project memory files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) for persistent context
- Systematic debugging protocol for markdown rendering issues

**Stage 4: Integration (Lesson 8)** — Capstone project
- Conduct systematic framework evaluation through documentation analysis
- Produce a 2-page framework comparison report
- Demonstrate all accumulated skills in a professional scenario

## Prerequisites

**You should have completed**:
- **Chapter 7 (Bash Essentials)**: Command-line fundamentals, file paths, shell syntax
- **Chapter 8 (Git/GitHub)**: Version control, repository structure, commit history
- **Chapter 9 (Markdown)**: Documentation syntax, reading technical docs

**You should have installed**:
- **Claude Code** (Chapter 5) OR **Gemini CLI** (Chapter 6) — minimum one required
- Access to framework documentation (FastAPI, Django, Flask) for practice

**You should be comfortable with**:
- Navigating directories using Bash commands
- Reading technical documentation and markdown files
- Strategic thinking about framework evaluation and trade-offs

---

## Learning Outcomes

**By the end of this chapter, you will be able to**:

1. **Explore framework documentation systematically** using AI CLI tools to extract design decisions and trade-offs
2. **Generate professional markdown documentation** (READMEs, API docs, tutorials) with 95%+ quality through iterative refinement
3. **Complete documentation exploration 3x faster** than linear reading
4. **Select appropriate Claude Code tools** (Read vs WebFetch vs Grep) for 5 distinct documentation tasks
5. **Write functional Gemini CLI custom commands** (TOML format) for markdown generation workflows
6. **Produce actionable framework comparison reports** using specification-first methodology
7. **Articulate how prompt engineering methodology transfers** from documentation to Python coding (Part 4)

## Teaching Approach: Specification-First + Socratic Dialogue

This chapter uses a **discovery-based pedagogy** (different from Chapter 9's direct teaching):

**Specification-First**: Every lesson starts with "What should this enable you to do?" before showing syntax
**Socratic Dialogue**: Analytical questions guide you to discover patterns instead of being told them
**Professional Framing**: All examples use real business scenarios (vendor evaluation, competitive analysis)

You'll learn by **reasoning about what makes prompts effective** (not memorizing templates).

---

## Time Investment

- **8 Lessons**: ~45-60 minutes each (6-8 hours total)
- **Capstone Project**: 2-3 hours (codebase analysis + report writing)
- **Total Chapter Time**: 8-11 hours

**Recommended pace**: 2-3 lessons per week over 3-4 weeks. The capstone requires accumulated knowledge from all prior lessons.

---

## Platform Flexibility

This chapter teaches **universal prompt engineering patterns** applicable to both Claude Code and Gemini CLI. Platform-specific lessons cover:

- **Lesson 4**: Claude Code tools for documentation exploration (Read, WebFetch, Grep)
- **Lesson 5**: Gemini CLI commands for markdown automation (@filename, !command, TOML)

**You can complete the chapter using EITHER platform.** The capstone project works with either tool.

---

## Professional Context

**This chapter is designed for**:

- **Developers**: Learning new frameworks through systematic documentation exploration
- **Technical Writers**: Generating professional markdown documentation efficiently
- **Developer Relations**: Creating tutorial content and educational materials
- **Students/Beginners**: Building foundation for Python coding (Part 4) through non-coding practice

**Coding skills are NOT required.** The focus is methodology (prompt engineering patterns that transfer to Python later).

---

## What Makes This Chapter Different

**Generic Prompt Engineering Tutorials**:
- Teach ChatGPT prompts for general tasks
- Focus on "write code faster" productivity hacks
- Use toy examples ("Create a todo app")
- Platform-agnostic (ignores CLI-specific capabilities)

**This Chapter**:
- Teaches Claude Code/Gemini CLI specifically for documentation exploration and markdown generation
- Focus on systematic learning methodology that transfers to Python coding (Part 4)
- Uses professional scenarios (framework evaluation, documentation creation, specification writing)
- Exploits platform-specific features (WebFetch tool, Grep, custom TOML commands)

**The difference**: You'll learn **complete prompt engineering methodology** using non-coding substrates (documentation, markdown) that transfer perfectly when Python starts.

## Constitution Compliance

This chapter adheres to **Constitution v6.0.0** reasoning-activated pedagogy:

- **4-Stage Teaching Framework**: Manual → Collaboration → Intelligence → Spec-Driven
- **Three Roles CoLearning**: AI as Teacher, Student, and Co-Worker (Lessons 3-5)
- **B1 Tier Cognitive Load**: 7-10 concepts per lesson (intermediate developers)
- **Specification Primacy**: WHAT capabilities before HOW syntax
- **Factual Accuracy**: All technical claims verified against official documentation
- **Minimal Content**: Every section maps to measurable learning objectives

---

## Capstone Preview: Framework Comparison Report

**Scenario**: You're evaluating three Python web frameworks (FastAPI, Django, Flask) for a new project. You have 2 hours before the architecture meeting to produce evidence-based recommendation.

**Deliverable**: 2-page framework comparison covering:

**Page 1: Architecture Comparison**
- Comparison table (design decisions, strengths, limitations)
- Core abstractions and design philosophy for each framework
- Trade-offs explicitly stated

**Page 2: Strategic Recommendation**
- Specific framework recommendation with rationale
- Decision framework (when to choose X vs Y vs Z)
- Adoption plan (timeline, risks, mitigation)

**Success criteria**: Engineering team can make informed framework decision based on your report — recommendations are specific, evidence-based, and actionable.

---

## Getting Started

**Lesson 1** begins by asking: "How do AI agents think differently than search engines?" You'll build the mental model for exploring documentation systematically, not just reading linearly.

No AI tools yet. Just reasoning about how to learn frameworks efficiently.

Ready? Let's master documentation exploration and markdown generation — skills that transfer directly to Python coding in Part 4.
