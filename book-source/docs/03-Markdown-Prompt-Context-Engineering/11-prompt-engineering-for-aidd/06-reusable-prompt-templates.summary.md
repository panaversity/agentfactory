### Core Concept
Capture recurring prompt patterns (2+ uses with consistent structure) into reusable templates with placeholders, ensuring consistency and reducing 5-10 minute custom prompts to 2-minute template fills.

### Key Mental Models
- **Template Encoding**: Effective templates encode Zia's 8-Element Framework (Command, Context, Logic, Roleplay, Formatting, Constraints, Examples, Questions) into structured sections
- **Recurrence + Pattern + Value**: Template creation requires all three (task recurs 2+, structure is consistent, future benefit exists)
- **Template Evolution**: v1 from examples → v2 after usage reveals gaps → v3 stable (templates improve each iteration)
- **Structured Sections**: Problem/Context/Constraints/Output sections enforce completeness (vs vague prompts)

### Critical Patterns
- **Template Structure**: Purpose → Placeholders (`[ALL_CAPS]`) → Sections → Usage Notes → Optional Examples
- **Three Core Templates**: Bug Fix (diagnostic), Refactoring (transformative), Documentation (generative) provide starting point
- **Placeholder Clarity**: Specific names (`[COMPONENT_NAME]`), type hints, examples prevent misuse
- **Usage Notes**: Guidance on filling placeholders and common mistakes prevents shallow/vague template fills

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Templates encode team conventions and project-specific constraints (AI learns what good outputs look like)
- Structured sections guide AI toward comprehensive reasoning (each section activates different reasoning pathways)
- Template metadata (category, tags, version) enables AI to recommend appropriate template for task type
- Template evolution captures what users discover (each iteration makes templates more effective for similar tasks)

### Common Mistakes
- Templates too generic (just vague prompts with placeholders, not structured)
- Too many placeholders (>8 → cognitive overload, faster to write custom)
- No usage guidance (users fill vaguely → mediocre results → blame template)
- Not evolving templates (static after creation, miss improvements from usage)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Question-Driven Development (templates encode QDD workflows), specification primacy (templates ARE specifications)
- **Leads to**: Template selection (decision frameworks for when to use vs custom), template library (organize and discover templates)
