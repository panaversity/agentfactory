# Lesson 1: Markdown as Specification Language

Before you write a single line of code, you need to describe WHAT you're building. That's where markdown comes in.

Markdown isn't just for making text look nice. It's the **Intent Layer** of Spec-Driven Development—the structured language you use to tell AI agents what to build so they can figure out how to build it.

In this lesson, you'll learn markdown basics by writing specifications manually. No AI help yet. You need to understand the structure first.

---

## Why Markdown for Specifications?

Think about how you communicate with a builder when renovating your house:

**Option 1: Unstructured (Bad)**
> "I want a nice kitchen. Make it modern. Good storage. Nice counters. Maybe an island?"

**Option 2: Structured Specification (Good)**
```
Kitchen Renovation Specification

## Layout
- U-shaped configuration (12x10 ft)
- Central island with seating (4x3 ft)
- Work triangle: sink, stove, refrigerator (max 6 ft between)

## Storage Requirements
- Upper cabinets: 8 units (glass front)
- Lower cabinets: 10 units (soft-close drawers)
- Pantry: Walk-in (5x6 ft)

## Expected Result
- 30% more storage than current kitchen
- Island seats 4 people comfortably
- All work triangle distances ≤ 6 ft
```

**What's the difference?**

The first is vague. The builder guesses what "nice" means. You might get something completely different from what you imagined.

The second is specific. The builder knows exactly what you want. The specification is **unambiguous**.

## Markdown's Role: Intent Layer of SDD-RI

In **Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI)**, there are three layers:

1. **Intent Layer** (Markdown) ← **YOU ARE HERE**
   - WHAT you want to build
   - Written in structured markdown
   - Clear, human-readable, AI-parseable

2. **Intelligence Layer** (Skills/Subagents)
   - Reusable components that AI agents use
   - Created from recurring patterns
   - Compounds across projects

3. **Implementation Layer** (Code)
   - HOW to build what you specified
   - Generated by AI agents
   - Python, JavaScript, Bash, etc.

**Your job right now**: Master the Intent Layer (markdown). AI agents will handle the Implementation Layer (code) later.

---

## Concept 1: Specification vs Implementation

Let's see the difference between describing WHAT (specification) and showing HOW (implementation):

### Example: User Registration Feature

**Specification (Markdown - WHAT)**:
```
## User Registration

### What This Feature Does
User can create account with email and password.

### Inputs Required
- Email address (must be valid format)
- Password (minimum 8 characters)

### Expected Behavior
When user submits valid email and password, system:
1. Creates user account
2. Shows confirmation message: "Account created successfully"
3. Redirects to dashboard

### Edge Cases
- If email already exists: "This email is already registered"
- If password too short: "Password must be at least 8 characters"
```

**Implementation (Python Code - HOW)**:
```python
def register_user(email, password):
    if len(password) < 8:
        return {"error": "Password must be at least 8 characters"}
    if email_exists(email):
        return {"error": "This email is already registered"}
    create_account(email, hash_password(password))
    return {"success": "Account created successfully"}
```

**Notice**:
- Specification describes WHAT happens (user creates account, system shows confirmation)
- Implementation shows HOW to code it (Python function, if statements, function calls)
- Same intent, completely different languages

**Why does this matter?**

One specification can be implemented many different ways:
- Python implementation
- JavaScript implementation
- Go implementation
- All three achieve the same specification

The specification is **stable**. The implementation is **flexible**.

In AI-native development, **you write specifications**. **AI writes code**.

## Concept 2: Heading Hierarchy for Document Structure

Markdown uses `#` symbols to create heading levels. This creates visual hierarchy and helps AI agents parse your document structure.

### Heading Syntax

```
# Main Title (H1 - Largest)
The top-level heading. Usually the system or document name.

## Section Heading (H2)
Major sections like features, requirements, or components.

### Subsection Heading (H3)
Details within sections.

#### Minor Heading (H4)
Further details (use sparingly).
```

### Why Hierarchy Matters

Headings organize specifications from general → specific:

**Example: Task Management System**

```
# Task Management System
(Highest level - what is this system?)

## Core Features
(What does the system provide?)

### Create Task
(Specific feature: what does "create task" do?)

### View All Tasks
(Specific feature: what does "view tasks" do?)

### Mark Task Complete
(Specific feature: what does "mark complete" do?)
```

**AI agents parse this hierarchy**:
- `# Task Management System` → This is about a task manager
- `## Core Features` → These are the main capabilities
- `### Create Task` → This is one specific feature

Clear hierarchy = Clear understanding.

---

## Concept 3: Feature > Sub-feature > Requirement Structure

When writing specifications, think in layers:

**Layer 1: System Overview** (H1)
What is this system?

**Layer 2: Feature Categories** (H2)
What broad capabilities does it have?

**Layer 3: Individual Features** (H3)
What specific things can users do?

### Example: E-Book Reader Specification

```
# E-Book Reader

## Reading Features

### Open Book
User can select book from library and open it for reading.

Expected behavior:
- Book opens to last read page
- Reading progress saved automatically
- Page numbers displayed at bottom

### Bookmark Page
User can save current page for quick return later.

Expected behavior:
- Bookmark icon appears in corner
- User clicks to save bookmark
- Bookmarked pages appear in sidebar list

## Library Management

### Add Book to Library
User can import EPUB or PDF files into library.

Expected behavior:
- System supports EPUB and PDF formats
- Book cover extracted and displayed
- Author and title metadata shown

### Search Library
User can search for books by title or author.

Expected behavior:
- Search box at top of library
- Results appear as user types
- Matching books highlighted
```

**Notice the pattern**:
- `# E-Book Reader` = System name
- `## Reading Features` = Feature category
- `### Open Book` = Specific feature
- Description below heading = WHAT it does

This structure is **repeatable**. You can apply it to any system specification.

---

## Concept 4: Plain Text Editors (No Formatting Tools)

Markdown is written in **plain text**. That means:

**Use these editors**:
- VS Code
- Sublime Text
- Nano (terminal)
- Vim (terminal)
- Any text editor that saves `.md` files

**Do NOT use these**:
- Microsoft Word (adds hidden formatting)
- Google Docs (adds hidden formatting)
- WYSIWYG markdown editors (you need to see raw markdown)

**Why plain text?**

AI agents read the raw markdown syntax, not the rendered HTML. You need to see what the AI sees.

### How to Create Your First Markdown File

1. Open your text editor
2. Create new file
3. Save as `specification.md` (`.md` extension is important)
4. Write markdown using `#` for headings
5. Save file

That's it. No special software needed.

---

## Concept 5: Manual Validation (Checking Your Own Syntax)

Before AI helps you, practice checking your own markdown syntax.

### Correct Heading Example

```
# Main System Name

## Feature Category

### Individual Feature

Description of what this feature does.
```

**What makes this correct?**
- Space after `#` symbols (required)
- One blank line after each heading (readability)
- Consistent nesting (H1 → H2 → H3, not random)

### Broken Heading Example 1 (No Space)

```
#Main System Name
##Feature Category
```

**Problem**: Missing space after `#`. This breaks markdown parsers.

**Fix**: Add space: `# Main System Name`

### Broken Heading Example 2 (Inconsistent Nesting)

```
# Main System

#### Random Detail (skipped H2 and H3)

## Feature (went backwards from H4 to H2)
```

**Problem**: Skipped heading levels. Went from H1 → H4 → H2. Confusing structure.

**Fix**: Use consistent nesting:
```
# Main System

## Feature Category

### Individual Feature

#### Minor Detail (if needed)
```

### Validation Checklist

When you write markdown, ask yourself:

1. ✅ Is there a space after each `#` symbol?
2. ✅ Did I skip any heading levels (H1 → H3)?
3. ✅ Are headings in logical order (general → specific)?
4. ✅ Is each heading on its own line?

If all answers are yes → Valid markdown!

## Concept 6: Why AI Agents Need Structured Specifications

**Question**: Why can't I just tell the AI "Build me a task manager" and let it figure out the details?

**Answer**: You CAN do that. But you'll get a **generic solution** that might not match what you actually need.

**Example: Unstructured Request**

> "Build me a task manager"

**What AI might assume**:
- Web app (maybe you wanted CLI app)
- User authentication (maybe you wanted single-user only)
- Cloud database (maybe you wanted local files)
- Many features (maybe you wanted 3-4 features only)

**Result**: You spend hours correcting what AI built because you weren't clear.

**Example: Structured Specification**

```
# Task Manager (CLI Application)

## System Overview
Simple command-line task manager for single user.
Local file storage (no cloud, no database).
MVP: 3 core features only.

## Core Features

### Create Task
User types task name, system saves to local file.

### View All Tasks
User sees list of all tasks with completion status.

### Mark Task Complete
User selects task number, system marks as complete.

## Non-Goals (NOT building)
- User authentication (single user only)
- Web interface (CLI only)
- Cloud sync (local files only)
- Task priorities (future feature)
```

**What AI now knows**:
- CLI app (not web)
- Single user (no authentication)
- Local files (no database)
- 3 features (not 20)

**Result**: AI builds exactly what you specified. Less back-and-forth. Faster delivery.

**The clearer your specification, the better the AI implementation.**

## Practice Exercise: Create Your First Specification

Now it's your turn. Pick ONE system from these options:

**Option 1: Recipe Collection**
- Store recipes with ingredients and steps
- Search recipes by name
- View recipe details

**Option 2: Daily Planner**
- Add events with time and description
- View today's schedule
- Mark events as complete

**Option 3: Reading List**
- Add books with title and author
- Mark books as read/unread
- View all books in list

### Instructions (Do This Manually)

1. **Open your text editor** (VS Code, Sublime, Nano, Vim)

2. **Create new file**: Save as `my-first-spec.md`

3. **Write specification using this template**:

```
# [System Name]

## System Overview
[One sentence: What is this system?]

## Core Features

### [Feature 1 Name]
[What does this feature do?]

Expected behavior:
- [What happens when user uses this feature?]

### [Feature 2 Name]
[What does this feature do?]

Expected behavior:
- [What happens when user uses this feature?]

### [Feature 3 Name]
[What does this feature do?]

Expected behavior:
- [What happens when user uses this feature?]
```

4. **Replace placeholders** with your system details

5. **Check your syntax** using the validation checklist:
   - ✅ Space after each `#` symbol?
   - ✅ Consistent heading nesting (H1 → H2 → H3)?
   - ✅ Each heading on its own line?
   - ✅ Blank lines between sections?

6. **Save file**

### Success Criteria

**You succeed when**:
- ✅ You have a `.md` file with 3-level heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- ✅ All heading syntax is correct (space after `#`, consistent nesting)
- ✅ Each feature describes WHAT it does (not HOW to code it)
- ✅ Specification is clear enough that someone else could understand the system

**Example success**: Your specification is so clear that if you gave it to a developer, they'd know exactly what to build without asking questions.

## Try With AI

Now that you've created your specification manually, let's validate it with AI.

**Setup**: Open Claude Code or Gemini CLI (from Chapter 5-6).

**Your Task**: Share your specification and ask AI to check your markdown syntax.

**Prompt**:
```
I'm learning markdown for specifications. I created this specification manually.
Please check my markdown syntax:
1. Are my headings formatted correctly (space after # symbols)?
2. Is my heading hierarchy consistent (H1 → H2 → H3)?
3. Did I describe WHAT the system does (not HOW to code it)?

[Paste your specification here]
```

**Expected Outcome**:

AI will review your syntax and tell you:
- ✅ If your headings are correctly formatted
- ✅ If your hierarchy makes sense
- ⚠️ If you have syntax errors (missing spaces, skipped levels)
- ⚠️ If you accidentally described implementation instead of specification

**If AI finds errors**: Fix them in your file, save, and check again.

**If AI confirms correctness**: You've written valid markdown! You're ready for Lesson 2.

**Safety Note**: AI is checking your markdown syntax here, not generating new specifications. You did the creative work (writing the spec). AI is the validator.
