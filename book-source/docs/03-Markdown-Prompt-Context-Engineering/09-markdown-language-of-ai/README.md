# Chapter 9: Markdown - The Language of AI Communication

Markdown is the **Intent Layer** of Spec-Driven Development. It's how you tell AI agents WHAT to build—clearly, structured, and unambiguously—so they can figure out HOW to implement it.

By the end of this chapter, you'll write specifications in markdown that AI agents can parse and implement. This is the foundation of AI-native development: specification-first thinking.

**No programming code in this chapter.** You'll learn specification language (markdown) BEFORE implementation language (Python in Part 4).

## What You'll Learn

This chapter teaches **markdown as a specification language** through 5 progressive lessons:

- **Markdown as Specification Language** — Understand markdown's role as Intent Layer, learn the difference between specification (WHAT) and implementation (HOW), create document hierarchy using heading levels, practice manual validation of markdown syntax
- **Lists for Structured Requirements** — Use bullet lists for alternative options, numbered lists for sequential requirements, distinguish when to use bullets vs numbers, collaborate with AI to refine list structure
- **Code Blocks for Specifications (Not Code)** — Use code blocks for expected outputs and API descriptions, show WHAT system does (specifications) not HOW it's built (implementation), iterate with AI to converge on unambiguous specification
- **Links, Images, and Reusable Templates** — Use links to reference authoritative sources, use images for diagrams and examples, create reusable Feature Specification Template using Persona + Questions + Principles pattern, apply template to new features
- **Complete System Specification (Capstone)** — Write specification FIRST for task management system (3-4 core features), compose all markdown skills (headings, lists, code blocks, links), validate specification clarity through AI feedback WITHOUT implementation, produce complete `spec.md` clear enough that AI could implement from spec alone
