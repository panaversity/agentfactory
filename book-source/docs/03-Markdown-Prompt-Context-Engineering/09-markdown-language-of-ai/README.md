# Chapter 9: Markdown - The Language of AI Communication

Markdown is the **Intent Layer** of Spec-Driven Development. It's how you tell AI agents WHAT to build—clearly, structured, and unambiguously—so they can figure out HOW to implement it.

By the end of this chapter, you'll write specifications in markdown that AI agents can parse and implement. This is the foundation of AI-native development: specification-first thinking.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter teaches **markdown as a specification language** through 5 progressive lessons:

### **Lesson 1: Markdown as Specification Language**
**Duration**: 45 minutes | **Stage**: 1 (Manual Foundation)

- Understand markdown's role as Intent Layer in SDD-RI
- Learn the difference between specification (WHAT) and implementation (HOW)
- Create document hierarchy using heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Practice manual validation of markdown syntax

**Why this matters**: Before AI helps you, you need to understand markdown's structure yourself.

---

### **Lesson 2: Lists for Structured Requirements**
**Duration**: 50 minutes | **Stage**: 2 (AI Collaboration Begins)

- Use bullet lists (`-`) for alternative options
- Use numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for sequential requirements
- Distinguish when to use bullets vs numbers
- **Collaborate with AI**: See AI suggest list structure, refine it with your constraints, converge on clarity

**Why this matters**: Requirements must be enumerated clearly. Lists make specifications machine-readable.

---

### **Lesson 3: Code Blocks for Specifications (Not Code)**
**Duration**: 55 minutes | **Stage**: 2 (AI Collaboration Deepened)

- Use code blocks (` ``` `) for expected outputs and API descriptions
- Show WHAT system does (specifications), not HOW it's built (implementation)
- **Iterate with AI**: AI suggests output format, you refine with domain knowledge, both converge on unambiguous specification
- Validate specification clarity through AI feedback

**Critical**: Code blocks demonstrate specifications (expected behavior), NOT programming code.

---

### **Lesson 4: Links, Images, and Reusable Templates**
**Duration**: 50 minutes | **Stage**: 3 (Intelligence Design)

- Use links (`[text](url)`) to reference authoritative sources
- Use images (`![alt](url)`) for diagrams and examples
- **Create reusable intelligence**: Feature Specification Template using Persona + Questions + Principles pattern
- Apply template to new features without referring to lessons

**Why this matters**: Intelligence that compounds. Build it once, reuse across projects.

---

### **Lesson 5: Complete System Specification (Capstone)**
**Duration**: 75 minutes | **Stage**: 4 (Spec-Driven Integration)

- Write **specification FIRST** for task management system (3-4 core features)
- Compose all markdown skills: headings (organization), lists (requirements), code blocks (outputs), links (references)
- Validate specification clarity through AI feedback WITHOUT implementation
- Understand markdown's role as Intent Layer in Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI)

**Deliverable**: Complete `spec.md` for task manager—clear enough that AI could implement from spec alone.

## Teaching Approach: Specification-First Modality

This chapter uses **specification-first pedagogy**:

1. **Stage 1 (Lesson 1)**: Learn markdown manually—no AI yet. Build foundation.
2. **Stage 2 (Lessons 2-3)**: Collaborate with AI as Teacher, Student, and Co-Worker. Iterate toward clarity.
3. **Stage 3 (Lesson 4)**: Create reusable specification templates—intelligence design.
4. **Stage 4 (Lesson 5)**: Write complete system specification FIRST, validate through AI feedback.

**No programming code in this chapter.** You'll learn specification language (markdown) BEFORE implementation language (Python in Part 4).

## Prerequisites

**Before starting this chapter, you should have**:
- Completed Chapters 1-8 (AI tool landscape, Bash essentials, Git fundamentals)
- Access to AI agent (Claude Code or Gemini CLI) for "Try With AI" exercises
- Text editor for creating markdown files

---

## Success Criteria

**You succeed when**:
- ✅ You can write clear feature specifications in markdown (headings, lists, code blocks, links)
- ✅ You distinguish specifications (WHAT system does) from implementation (HOW it's built)
- ✅ Your specifications are clear enough that AI agents can implement from them
- ✅ You've created at least one reusable specification template (from Lesson 4)
- ✅ You've completed capstone: Task management system specification with ALL components

---

**Remember**: In AI-native development, **writing specifications is the primary skill**. Code is what AI generates FROM your specifications.

This chapter teaches you to communicate intent clearly. Part 4 (Python) will teach implementation. Part 5 (Spec-Driven Development) will teach orchestration.

**Start with Lesson 1** to build your manual foundation.
