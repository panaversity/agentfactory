# Lesson 4: Links, Images, and Reusable Templates

You've learned the core markdown elements: headings (structure), lists (requirements), and code blocks (outputs). Now you'll add **references** and create **reusable intelligence**.

This lesson marks a shift: from writing individual specifications to **designing intelligence that compounds across projects**. You'll create a **Feature Specification Template** that you can reuse anytime you need to describe a new feature—without referring back to this lesson.

This is intelligence design: build it once, use it everywhere.

---

## Why References Matter in Specifications

**Problem**: Specifications can't exist in isolation. They need to reference:
- Industry standards (OAuth 2.0 spec, REST API conventions)
- Documentation (library docs, framework guides)
- Examples (design patterns, best practices)
- Related work (similar features, prior decisions)

**Solution**: Links and images make specifications **connected** instead of **isolated**.

---

## Concept 1: Links for Reference Materials

Markdown links use this syntax: `[link text](URL)`

### Basic Link Syntax

```markdown
See [CommonMark specification](https://commonmark.org/) for markdown standard.
```

**Rendered**: See [CommonMark specification](https://commonmark.org/) for markdown standard.

**What this does**:
- Clickable text: "CommonMark specification"
- Points to: https://commonmark.org/
- Readers can verify your references

### When to Use Links in Specifications

**Scenario 1: Reference Industry Standards**

```markdown
## Authentication

Implementation must follow [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://oauth.net/2/).

Security requirements:
- [OWASP Authentication Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-authentication/)
- [NIST Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)
```

**Why this matters**: Developers know exactly which standards to follow. No ambiguity about "secure authentication."

**Scenario 2: Link to API Documentation**

```markdown
## Payment Processing

Use [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) for payment handling.

Required endpoints:
- [Create Payment Intent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/create)
- [Confirm Payment](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm)
```

Developers can click directly to the relevant API docs instead of searching.

**Scenario 3: Reference Design Patterns**

```markdown
## Task State Management

Implement using [State Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state).

States:
- Created (initial)
- In Progress
- Completed
- Archived

State transitions follow pattern described in [Gang of Four documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern).
```

Links provide context and learning resources.

---

## Concept 2: Images for Diagrams and Examples

Markdown images use similar syntax: `![alt text](image URL)`

### Basic Image Syntax

```markdown
![Task workflow diagram](https://example.com/images/task-workflow.png)
```

**What this shows**:
- Image displayed inline
- Alt text: "Task workflow diagram" (for accessibility and if image fails to load)
- Image source: URL or relative path

### When to Use Images in Specifications

**Scenario 1: Show User Interface Mockups**

```markdown
## Login Screen Design

![Login screen mockup](./mockups/login-screen.png)

Required elements:
- Email input field
- Password input field (masked)
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot password?" link
- "Login" button

Layout matches mockup above.
```

**Why this helps**: Visual reference removes ambiguity about UI layout.

**Scenario 2: Show System Architecture**

```markdown
## System Architecture

![Architecture diagram](./diagrams/system-architecture.png)

Components:
- Frontend (React)
- API Gateway (Node.js)
- Task Service (Python)
- Database (PostgreSQL)

Data flow shown in diagram above.
```

One diagram explains relationships better than paragraphs of text.

**Scenario 3: Show Expected Output (Screenshot)**

```markdown
## Dashboard View

![Dashboard screenshot](./screenshots/dashboard-example.png)

User sees:
- Welcome message with name
- Today's tasks (left panel)
- This week's progress (right panel)
- Quick action buttons (bottom)

Visual layout matches screenshot.
```

Screenshot sets clear expectations for developers and designers.

## Recognizing Patterns: From Lessons 1-3

Before creating a reusable template, let's identify patterns from what you've learned.

**Reflection Question 1**: What structure did ALL your feature specifications have?

Think about Lessons 1-3. When you specified features, you included:
- Feature name (heading)
- What it does (description)
- What inputs it needs
- What outputs it produces
- What edge cases to handle

**This is a repeatable pattern.**

**Reflection Question 2**: What questions did you ALWAYS ask yourself?

When writing specifications, you asked:
- What is this feature's purpose?
- What does the user provide?
- What does the system return?
- What can go wrong?
- How do I know it works?

**These questions guide every specification.**

**Reflection Question 3**: What principles helped you decide what to include?

You learned principles like:
- Be specific (not vague)
- Show WHAT, not HOW
- Handle edge cases
- Reference authoritative sources
- Make it measurable

**These principles apply to every feature.**

---

## Concept 3: Creating Reusable Specification Templates

Now that you recognize patterns, encode them as a **reusable template**.

**Template structure**:
1. **Persona**: Establishes thinking stance ("Think like X to achieve Y")
2. **Analysis Questions**: Force reasoning about the feature
3. **Principles**: Guide decisions
4. **Template**: Reusable structure to fill in

### Feature Specification Template (Example)

```markdown
# Feature Specification Template

## Persona
"Think like a requirements engineer ensuring any developer could implement this feature unambiguously from the specification alone."

## Analysis Questions

Before writing specification, answer:

1. **What is this feature doing?**
   - One clear sentence describing purpose
   - Why does the user need this?

2. **What inputs does the user provide?**
   - Required vs optional
   - Data types and formats
   - Validation rules

3. **What outputs does the system produce?**
   - Success case: What does user see?
   - Data returned: What information is shown?

4. **What edge cases exist?**
   - Empty inputs
   - Invalid inputs
   - System failures
   - Boundary conditions

5. **How do we validate success?**
   - Measurable criteria
   - Observable behavior
   - Time constraints

## Principles

When writing feature specifications:

1. **Unambiguous Intent**: Any developer reading this knows exactly what to build
2. **Complete Scope**: Nothing left to assumptions
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Handle failures gracefully
4. **Reference Authority**: Link to standards, patterns, documentation
5. **Measurable Success**: Clear validation criteria

## Template Structure

Use this structure for any feature:

---

### [Feature Name]

**Purpose**: [One sentence: what does this feature do and why?]

**References**:
- [Link to relevant standard/pattern/documentation]

#### Inputs

**Required:**
- [Input 1 name] (type, constraints)
- [Input 2 name] (type, constraints)

**Optional:**
- [Optional input] (type, default value)

#### Expected Output (Success Case)

**System displays:**
```
[Exact output text/format]
```

**System returns:**
```
[API response or data structure]
```

#### Edge Cases

**If [condition 1]:**
```
[Error message or handling behavior]
```

**If [condition 2]:**
```
[Error message or handling behavior]
```

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ [Measurable criterion 1]
- ✅ [Measurable criterion 2]
- ✅ [Measurable criterion 3]

---
```

**What makes this template reusable**:
- **Persona** activates the right mindset (not just copying structure)
- **Questions** force analysis of the specific feature (not generic)
- **Principles** guide decisions when filling template
- **Template** provides consistent structure across all features

---

## Concept 4: Applying Template to Novel Feature

Let's test the template on a feature you haven't specified before: **Delete Task**.

**Before template**: You might write:
```
## Delete Task
User can remove tasks they don't need anymore.
```

Vague. What confirms deletion? What if task doesn't exist? What if it's already deleted?

**Using template**:

### Step 1: Answer Analysis Questions

1. **What is this feature doing?**
   - Permanently removes task from system
   - User needs this to clean up completed or obsolete tasks

2. **What inputs does user provide?**
   - Required: Task ID (integer)

3. **What outputs does system produce?**
   - Success: Confirmation message, task removed from list
   - Failure: Error if task not found

4. **What edge cases exist?**
   - Task ID doesn't exist
   - Task ID is invalid format (not a number)
   - User tries to delete already-deleted task

5. **How do we validate success?**
   - Task no longer appears in task list
   - Confirmation message appears within 1 second
   - Task count decrements by 1

### Step 2: Fill Template Structure

```markdown
### Delete Task

**Purpose**: Permanently remove task from system when user no longer needs it.

**References**:
- [Delete operation patterns](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/#delete)
- [User confirmation best practices](https://uxplanet.org/confirmation-dialogs-in-ui-design)

#### Inputs

**Required:**
- Task ID (integer, must exist in system)

#### Expected Output (Success Case)

**System displays:**
```
Task deleted successfully.
"[Task name]" has been removed.

Remaining tasks: 4
```

**System behavior:**
- Task removed from database
- Task no longer appears in task list
- Task count updated

#### Edge Cases

**If task ID doesn't exist:**
```
Error: Task not found
Unable to delete task #42. This task does not exist.
Please check the task ID and try again.
```

**If task ID invalid format (not a number):**
```
Error: Invalid task ID
Task ID must be a number.
Example: 42
```

**If delete operation fails:**
```
Error: Unable to delete task
System error occurred. Please try again.
If problem persists, contact support.
```

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Task deletion completes within 1 second
- ✅ Task no longer appears in list after deletion
- ✅ Task count decrements correctly
- ✅ Confirmation message includes deleted task name
- ✅ Error messages clear and actionable
```

**Notice**:
- You didn't refer back to Lessons 1-3
- Template guided you to complete specification
- All sections filled systematically
- Nothing missing

**This is intelligence reuse**: Template encodes knowledge from past work, applies to new scenarios.

## Concept 5: Template Quality Criteria

Not all templates are equally useful. Good templates:

**1. Activate Reasoning (Not Just Structure)**

❌ Bad template:
```
## [Feature Name]
Description: [...]
Requirements: [...]
```

This is just structure. Doesn't help you think through the problem.

✅ Good template:
```
## Persona
"Think like [role] ensuring [outcome]"

## Questions
1. What problem does this solve?
2. What constraints apply?
...
```

This activates analysis. You can't fill it mindlessly.

**2. Apply to 3+ Different Features (General, Not Specific)**

❌ Over-specific template:
```
## User Authentication Feature
OAuth provider: [Google/GitHub]
Redirect URL: [...]
Scope: [email, profile]
```

This only works for OAuth. Not reusable for password auth, API keys, etc.

✅ General template:
```
## Authentication Feature
Method: [OAuth / Password / API Key / SSO]
Security requirements: [...]
Success criteria: [...]
```

Applies to any authentication approach.

**3. Include Decision Frameworks (Principles)**

❌ No guidance:
```
## Feature Specification
Name: [...]
Description: [...]
```

You're on your own deciding what to include.

✅ With principles:
```
## Principles
1. Unambiguous Intent: Could any developer implement from this spec?
2. Edge Case Coverage: What can go wrong?
3. Measurable Success: How do we validate?
```

Principles guide what you write.

---

## Practice Exercise: Create Your Own Template

Now create a reusable template for a different context. Choose ONE:

**Option 1: Error Message Template**
- Create template for specifying any error message
- Include: when it appears, exact text, user actions, recovery steps

**Option 2: API Endpoint Template**
- Create template for specifying any API endpoint
- Include: method, path, request format, response format, status codes

**Option 3: User Story Template**
- Create template for writing user stories
- Include: who, what, why, acceptance criteria, edge cases

### Instructions

1. Open text editor
2. Create file: `my-template.md`
3. Structure:

```markdown
# [Your Template Name]

## Persona
"Think like [role] to ensure [outcome]"

## Analysis Questions

Before using this template, answer:

1. [Question that forces context analysis]
2. [Question that identifies constraints]
3. [Question that surfaces edge cases]
4. [Question that defines success]

## Principles

When using this template:

1. [Principle 1: what quality to ensure]
2. [Principle 2: what to avoid]
3. [Principle 3: what to reference]

## Template

[Your reusable structure here with placeholders]
```

4. Test by applying to two different scenarios
5. Refine if template doesn't work for both

### Success Criteria

**You succeed when**:
- ✅ Template includes Persona + Questions + Principles
- ✅ Template applies to 3+ different scenarios (not over-specific)
- ✅ Questions force reasoning (not just fill-in-the-blank)
- ✅ Principles guide decisions
- ✅ You can use template without referring back to this lesson

## Try With AI

Now validate your template's quality with AI feedback.

**Setup**: Open Claude Code or Gemini CLI.

**Exercise 1: Template Quality Check**

**Prompt:**
```
I created a reusable template for [your template topic].
Review this template and tell me:

1. Does the Persona activate the right thinking stance?
2. Do the Questions force analysis (not just structure-filling)?
3. Are the Principles helpful for decision-making?
4. Is this template general enough to apply to 3+ different scenarios?

[Paste your template]
```

**What to expect**: AI will evaluate:
- ✅ If persona is clear and actionable
- ⚠️ If questions are too generic or too specific
- ⚠️ If principles are vague ("be clear") vs actionable ("include measurable criteria")
- ⚠️ If template is over-fitted to one scenario

**Exercise 2: Test Template Reusability**

**Prompt:**
```
Use this template to specify [new scenario 1].

[Paste your template]

Fill in all sections for: [describe scenario]
```

**Then repeat with scenario 2 and 3.**

**What to notice**:
- Does template work for all scenarios?
- Are some sections always empty? (Template might be over-specific)
- Do you struggle to fill some sections? (Questions might be unclear)

If template doesn't work for all 3 scenarios → Refine and test again.

**Exercise 3: Refinement Iteration**

**Prompt:**
```
Based on testing my template with 3 scenarios, I found:
- [Issue 1: what didn't work]
- [Issue 2: what was unclear]

How should I revise the template to fix these issues?
```

AI suggests improvements. You refine. Test again with new scenarios.

**Expected Outcome**:

After 2-3 iterations:
- Template works for multiple different scenarios
- Persona, Questions, and Principles are clear and actionable
- You can use template without referring to this lesson
- AI confirms template quality

**Reflection Questions**:
1. What did AI teach you about template design?
2. How did testing with different scenarios reveal template weaknesses?
3. Can you now use this template on future projects without rereading this lesson?

**Safety Note**: Templates are reusable intelligence. You're creating tools you'll use repeatedly, not one-off specifications. Invest time in quality now; save time on every future use.
