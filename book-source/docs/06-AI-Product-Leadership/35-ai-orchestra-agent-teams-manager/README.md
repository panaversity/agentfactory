# Chapter 33: AI Orchestra – Manage Agent Teams

This chapter transforms you into an **AI team lead** — someone who can coordinate multiple agents to achieve complex goals. The skills you’ll build here apply equally to managing AI agents and leading human teams.

You’ll begin by **manually managing three agents**, learning how to break large problems into smaller, coordinated tasks — this foundational skill is called **decomposition thinking**.  
Next, you’ll explore how coordination scales: what works smoothly with three agents, and what starts to break as you move to five or seven.  

Finally, you’ll learn to orchestrate larger teams using **SpecKit Plus**, applying contracts and completion hooks to manage 5–7 autonomous agents working in parallel.  

## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

- **Decomposition Thinking** — Break complex systems into parallelizable units with clear, measurable contracts.
- **Task Management** — Coordinate three AI agents across Git worktrees, running SpecKit Plus commands simultaneously to experience a 2–3× speedup.
- **Scaling Analysis** — Identify what works at three agents, what changes at five to seven, and when automation becomes essential.
- **Team Lead Skills** — Transition from execution management to strategic oversight — validate against contracts rather than micromanaging processes.
- **SpecKit Plus Orchestration** — Use SpecKit Plus to coordinate 5–7 agents.

Most importantly, you’ll build lasting **decomposition muscle memory** — a skill that applies to AI coordination today and human leadership tomorrow.

This chapter emphasizes **thinking (60%) over tools (40%)**. Tools evolve; structured thinking endures.
By mastering decomposition, you'll gain the ability to lead AI agents, human teams, and agentic organizations — applying the same scalable mental models across any level of complexity.

By the end, you'll embody **creative independence** — leading both human and AI teams with clarity, structure, and confidence.
