### Core Concept
Vertical market success demands ALL THREE elements working in sync: domain expertise (via fine-tuned models OR vertical intelligence), deep integrations with existing systems, and complete agentic solutions. Missing any single requirement causes failure—there is no partial credit. Intelligence (accumulated domain knowledge encoded in fine-tuned models or vertical intelligence systems) creates defensibility because competitors must invest months rebuilding what you've learned—mirroring how Instagram's 13 employees used accumulated intelligence to become a $1B company.

### Key Mental Models
- **All-or-Nothing Interdependence**: The three requirements form an inseparable system—expertise without integrations is a sandbox; integrations without expertise is a wrapper; solutions without both are toys
- **Two Paths to Domain Expertise**: Fine-tune the AI model (expensive, powerful for pattern recognition) OR build vertical intelligence through sub-agents and skills (faster iteration, transparent, procedural workflows)
- **Defensibility Test**: Both fine-tuned models and well-architected skill libraries take months to build—competitors can't replicate in weeks
- **Intelligence as Competitive Asset**: Accumulated domain knowledge (whether fine-tuned into models or structured as vertical intelligence) creates defensibility because competitors must invest months rebuilding your understanding—the moat is knowledge, not code

### Critical Patterns
- Evaluate any AI product against all three requirements to predict success or failure
- Choose Path 1 (fine-tuning) when: large datasets available, subtle domain patterns, budget for retraining
- Choose Path 2 (vertical intelligence) when: expertise fits structured workflows, fast iteration needed, limited training data
- Defensibility comes from system-level knowledge, not individual components—a well-architected skill library is as defensible as a fine-tuned model because both require months of accumulated learning
- PPP phases map to requirements: Phase 1 → integrations, Phase 2 → domain expertise, Phase 3 → agentic solutions

### Common Mistakes
- Building a "feature" instead of a product by only partially addressing requirements (OpenAI Study Mode example)
- Treating deep integrations as optional—they require months of API work, compliance, and security audits
- Assuming fine-tuning is the only path to domain expertise—vertical intelligence (sub-agents + skills) is equally defensible
