### Core Concept
Vertical market success demands ALL THREE elements working in sync: domain expertise (via fine-tuned models OR vertical intelligence), deep integrations with existing systems, and complete agentic solutions. Missing any single requirement causes failure—there is no partial credit.

### Key Mental Models
- **All-or-Nothing Interdependence**: The three requirements form an inseparable system—expertise without integrations is a sandbox; integrations without expertise is a wrapper; solutions without both are toys
- **Two Paths to Domain Expertise**: Fine-tune the AI model (expensive, powerful for pattern recognition) OR build vertical intelligence through sub-agents and skills (faster iteration, transparent, procedural workflows)
- **Defensibility Test**: Both fine-tuned models and well-architected skill libraries take months to build—competitors can't replicate in weeks

### Critical Patterns
- Evaluate any AI product against all three requirements to predict success or failure
- Choose Path 1 (fine-tuning) when: large datasets available, subtle domain patterns, budget for retraining
- Choose Path 2 (vertical intelligence) when: expertise fits structured workflows, fast iteration needed, limited training data
- PPP phases map to requirements: Phase 1 → integrations, Phase 2 → domain expertise, Phase 3 → agentic solutions

### Common Mistakes
- Building a "feature" instead of a product by only partially addressing requirements (OpenAI Study Mode example)
- Treating deep integrations as optional—they require months of API work, compliance, and security audits
- Assuming fine-tuning is the only path to domain expertise—vertical intelligence (sub-agents + skills) is equally defensible

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Snakes and Ladders strategy (Lesson 2), PPP execution framework (Lesson 5)
- **Leads to**: Applying the three-requirements framework to your own vertical market choice
