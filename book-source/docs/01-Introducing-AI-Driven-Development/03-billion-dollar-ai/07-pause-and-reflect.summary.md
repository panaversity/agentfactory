### Core Concept
Frameworks are tools for thinking, not guarantees of success. Your execution, market timing, and ability to personalize these frameworks to YOUR situation matter more than any framework itself.

### Key Mental Models
- **Strategy Company vs Software Company**: Traditional software scales by hiring engineers; your business scales by market understanding, integration depth, and orchestration ability
- **Frameworks as Integrated System**: Snakes & Ladders, 90-10 economics, PPP strategy, and Three Requirements work together—synthesis creates strategic clarity that isolated frameworks cannot
- **Externalization Principle**: Reflection becomes clear when you write it down; thinking stays fuzzy when it stays internal

### Critical Patterns
- Personalize each framework to your specific vertical market, competitive advantages, and constraints
- Reality-check AI suggestions by pushing back with your domain knowledge and iterating until plans feel both ambitious and achievable
- Ask "What gives ME an unfair advantage?" when choosing competitive layer—generic analysis doesn't reveal this

### Common Mistakes
- Rushing the PPP timeline breaks trust; patience compounds it (enterprise customers need proof of reliability before pivot)
- Treating frameworks as recipes to follow rather than lenses to think through
- Spending time building code (software company mindset) instead of understanding markets and customers (strategy company mindset)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Chapter 3 frameworks—Snakes & Ladders, 90-10 economics, Vertical Intelligence, PPP strategy, Three Requirements
- **Leads to**: Personalized strategic execution using frameworks as ongoing decision tools
