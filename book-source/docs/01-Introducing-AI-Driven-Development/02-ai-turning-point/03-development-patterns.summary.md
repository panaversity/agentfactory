### Core Concept
Two fundamental development patterns exist: **vibe coding** (intuition-led, exploration-first) and **spec-driven development** (specification-first, method-led). Neither is universally right—but choosing the wrong pattern for your context creates predictable failures.

### Key Mental Models
- **"Fast Week One, Slow Week Two"**: Vibe coding delivers quick initial results but creates compounding rework costs as complexity grows
- **AI as Amplifier**: AI magnifies whatever practice you bring—discipline produces leverage, chaos produces faster chaos
- **"Specs Are the New Syntax"**: In AI-native development, articulating intent clearly IS the primary skill—specification quality directly determines output quality

### Critical Patterns
- Match approach to context: vibe coding for learning/exploration/low-stakes solo work; SDD for production/teams/maintenance
- The 7-step SDD workflow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement (Red-Green) → Refactor → Explain → Record/Share
- Before AI generates code, invest time in specification—the upfront cost prevents multiplied rework later

### Common Mistakes
- Using vibe coding for production features because "it's faster" (ignores week-two slowdown)
- Treating SDD as bureaucracy rather than context-appropriate discipline (blueprints for treehouses vs. office towers)
- Believing AI tools reduce the need for planning (AI makes discipline MORE critical, not less)
