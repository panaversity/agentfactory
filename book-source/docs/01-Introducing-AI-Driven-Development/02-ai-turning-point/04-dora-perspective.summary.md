### Core Concept
AI doesn't fix broken processes—it amplifies them. Organizations with strong practices (testing, code review, CI/CD) see 20-30% productivity gains; organizations with weak practices see initial velocity followed by stability degradation.

### Key Mental Models
- **Amplifier Effect**: AI multiplies existing capabilities—same tool produces opposite outcomes depending on your foundation. Strong foundation + AI = amplified excellence; weak foundation + AI = amplified problems.
- **Mountain Road Guardrails**: Safety systems (tests, reviews, CI/CD) don't slow you down—they give you confidence to take bigger risks and move faster. Without guardrails, you slow down out of fear.
- **Foundation Before Velocity**: Build the seven capabilities first, then scale AI adoption—skipping this step leads to net-negative outcomes.

### Critical Patterns
- Assess readiness using 7 DORA capabilities: Clear AI Stance, Healthy Data Ecosystem, AI-Accessible Internal Data, Strong Version Control, Working in Small Batches, User-Centric Focus, Quality Internal Platform
- Score 5-7 capabilities = ready to amplify strengths; 3-4 = mixed results; 0-2 = fix foundations first
- Design the smallest guardrail that addresses your weakest capability this week

### Common Mistakes
- Believing guardrails slow AI-driven development (they enable confident speed)
- Expecting better AI models to eliminate the need for strong practices (AI doesn't know your context or enforce discipline)
- Shipping faster without safety nets (velocity spike followed by firefighting)
