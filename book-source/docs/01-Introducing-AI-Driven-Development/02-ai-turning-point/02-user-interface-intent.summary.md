### Core Concept
Software interaction is shifting from User Interface (navigating menus, buttons, forms) to User Intent (expressing goals conversationally). Instead of users learning WHERE to click, AI agents understand WHAT users want and orchestrate the HOW autonomously.

### Key Mental Models
- **Interface vs. Intent**: Traditional UX = User → Interface → Action (14 manual steps). Agentic UX = User Intent → Agent → Orchestrated Actions (3 conversational exchanges).
- **The Five Powers**: AI agents achieve autonomous orchestration through five combined capabilities: See (visual understanding), Hear (audio processing), Reason (complex decision-making), Act (execute across systems), Remember (maintain context and learn).
- **Design Challenge Shift**: From "How do we make this interface intuitive?" to "How do we make this agent understand intent accurately?"

### Critical Patterns
- Individual AI powers are useful but limited; combined they create autonomous orchestration
- Agentic systems infer needs (scheduling Uber without being asked), remember preferences (quiet rooms, king beds), and integrate across systems (calendar, email, bookings)
- Three AI evolution phases: Predictive (analyze/forecast) → Generative (create content) → Agentic (take autonomous action)

### Common Mistakes
- Designing AI as a passive tool rather than an autonomous agent that orchestrates workflows
- Focusing on UI/UX optimization when the paradigm has shifted to intent modeling
- Thinking in prescribed steps (step 1 → step 2 → step 3) instead of adaptive, context-aware workflows
- Writing specifications as "when user clicks X, do Y" instead of "when user expresses intent Z (in any phrasing), agent understands and acts appropriately"

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Developer as orchestrator concept (Chapter 1), the AI inflection point (Lesson 2.1)
- **Leads to**: Vibe coding vs. Spec-Driven Development patterns (Lesson 2.3), understanding when discipline matters
