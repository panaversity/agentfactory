### Core Concept
The global developer economy represents approximately $3 trillion in annual value—an economy the size of France's GDP. AI coding tools are disrupting this massive market faster than any previous technology shift, not by shrinking it, but by dramatically expanding who can build software.

### Key Mental Models
- **Value vs. Salary**: Developers generate $100K+ in economic value annually through revenue, cost savings, and productivity gains—far exceeding their salaries. The difference flows to employers and customers.
- **Expansion Paradox**: Automation doesn't shrink markets—it expands them. Spreadsheets didn't eliminate accountants; they made financial analysis accessible to everyone. AI is doing the same for software development.
- **Acceleration Pattern**: Each technology wave adopts faster than the last (PC: 12 years, Internet: 10 years, Cloud: 15 years, Mobile: 8 years, AI coding: 3 years). Better infrastructure enables faster adoption.

### Critical Patterns
- Developer economy calculation: 30M developers × $100K generated value = $3T economy
- Scale reference points: Equal to France's GDP, India's GDP, or 2× Canada's GDP
- Value generation categories: direct revenue, cost savings, productivity gains, business enablement

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing developer salary with economic value generated (salary is a fraction of value created)
- Assuming AI will reduce developer demand (the "displacement fallacy"—historical evidence shows opposite)
- Believing you can "wait out" this transformation (early adopters of platform shifts capture disproportionate value)
- Learning what AI is best at (syntax, boilerplate) instead of what humans uniquely provide (judgment, creativity, domain expertise)

- **Builds on**: The AI Development Revolution introduction and Y Combinator data
- **Leads to**: Why software disrupting itself is fundamentally different from previous technology shifts
