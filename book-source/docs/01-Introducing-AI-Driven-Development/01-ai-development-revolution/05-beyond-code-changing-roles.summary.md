### Core Concept
Developer roles are transforming from "typist" (converting ideas into code character-by-character) to "orchestrator" (directing AI agents through clear specifications and quality judgment). Your value shifts from typing speed to decision quality.

### Key Mental Models
- **Typist → Orchestrator**: The constraint shifts from "how fast can we write code?" to "how quickly can we design good systems and make correct decisions?"
- **Four Dimensions of Orchestration**: (1) Specification & intent communication, (2) Architecture & system design, (3) Code review & quality judgment, (4) Agent supervision & iteration
- **Reusable Intelligence > Reusable Code**: Your future value isn't typing code faster—it's designing intelligence (subagents, skills, orchestration patterns) that compounds across projects

### Critical Patterns
- Write specifications precise enough for AI implementation: vague specs produce vague results
- Review AI code skeptically: check edge cases, security, performance, and domain-specific constraints
- Guide AI through specific feedback ("handles happy path, but throws exception for empty list") rather than vague requests ("fix it")
- Build reusable intelligence: subagents (5+ decisions), skills (2-4 decisions), orchestration patterns (3+ components)

### Common Mistakes
- Treating AI as a passive tool instead of a collaborative partner you direct, teach, and learn from
- Assuming AI replaces developers—it amplifies them by shifting the bottleneck from implementation to judgment
- Copy-pasting AI code without understanding or reviewing it
