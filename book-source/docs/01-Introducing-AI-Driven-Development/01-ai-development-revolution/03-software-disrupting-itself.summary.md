### Core Concept
Software is now disrupting itself—the industry that disrupted retail, transportation, and media is being transformed by AI tools from within. This internal disruption is happening 5-10x faster than external disruptions because developers are adopting voluntarily, with no resistance.

### Key Mental Models
- **External vs. Internal Disruption**: External disruption (software → retail) faces resistance and takes 8-20 years. Internal disruption (AI → software) has no opposition—developers embrace it—so it happens in ~3 years.
- **The Recursion Effect**: AI tools improve AI tools. Engineers at OpenAI, Anthropic, and GitHub use AI to build better AI. This feedback loop accelerates transformation exponentially.
- **No Safe Zone Principle**: Every software role and specialization is affected simultaneously—unlike cloud or mobile shifts where you could specialize elsewhere.

### Critical Patterns
- Timeline compression: 50% adoption took ~10 years for cloud, ~2 years for AI coding tools
- Four acceleration factors: immediate value, low switching cost, network effects, competitive pressure
- Universal impact: junior devs, seniors, DevOps, QA, technical writers—all roles are changing

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking you can "wait it out" in a specialized niche unaffected by AI—no such niche exists
- Treating this like previous gradual tech shifts (cloud, mobile) that allowed years to adapt
- Prioritizing syntax memorization when AI handles syntax—concepts and patterns matter now
