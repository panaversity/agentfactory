**Answer**:
- **Personal/Learning Projects**: Yes, for learning and personal experimentation
- **Open Source Projects**: Contact Panaversity for permission
- **Commercial Projects**: Contact Panaversity for commercial licensing

**Rationale**: The NoDerivatives (ND) clause means you cannot extract code examples and create a separate "code library" for distribution. However, reasonable use for learning is permitted under fair use principles.

**Answer**:
- **Personal use**: Yes, for learning and experimentation
- **Team/Commercial use**: Contact Panaversity for licensing

**Important**: These tools are integral to the educational content and are covered by the same license as the book itself. They are NOT separately licensed under MIT or other permissive licenses.
